It has been suggested that juveniles adopt a mix of strategies characteristic of both larvae and adults. Like larvae, they may feed opportunistically throughout winter when food is available, and like adults they may be able to suppress their metabolism when food is scarce. In this study we look at the overwinter strategies of juvenile krill and how their reproductive development changes when energy input exceeds what is necessary for survival. We take a closer look at how the sexual maturation of juvenile krill progresses in response to different environmental conditions throughout the fall and winter. We exposed juvenile Antarctic krill to four different ``food environment scenarios{''}, supplementing them with various diets from May to September 2019 that were representative of environmental conditions that they may encounter in different regions of the Western Antarctic Peninsula during autumn and winter. Each month, we measured the physiology and condition of the krill, and assessed the reproductive development of females. We found that when female juvenile krill have greater energy reserves than what is needed to survive the winter, they will begin to sexually mature. Further, when there are sufficient levels of the fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 16:4 (n-1), krill are likely to be in a more reproductive advanced stage. However, when lipids, EPA, DHA and 16:4 (n-1) are depleted throughout the winter, juvenile female krill lose their ability to develop reproductively. We also found that sexual development is an energy intensive process that requires high respiration rates in juvenile krill. Furthermore, when juvenile females expend energy maturing, their physiological condition declines. This trade-off between early reproductive development and condition in juvenile female krill has important implications for individual health and population fecundity. Gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms behind juvenile krill winter survival strategies and their consequences will allow us to predict how future change at the western Antarctic Peninsula may affect krill population dynamics, especially in light of a warming climate.","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","English","Steinke, KB (Corresponding Author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean \& Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.

The dependence of the physiological state of the studied aquatic organisms on changes in environmental parameters was analyzed. Current data on the association of the dynamics of hydrometeorological parameters and processes with the distribution of chlorophyll a, krill, and salp were obtained. It was established that, at numerous stations, the biomass of salps prevailed over krill. The result indicates the replacement of the Antarctic krill populations by gelatinous zooplankton.

However, it is often simulated as one generic group and top closure term in ocean biogeochemical models. This study presents the description of three zooplankton functional types (zPFTs, micro-, meso- and macrozooplankton) in the ocean biogeochemical model FESOM-REcoM. In the presented model, microzooplankton is a fast-growing herbivore group, mesozooplankton is another major consumer of phytoplankton, and macrozooplankton is a slow-growing group with a low temperature optimum. Meso- and macrozooplankton produce fast-sinking fecal pellets. With three zPFTs, the annual mean zooplankton biomass increases threefold to 210 Tg C. The new food web structure leads to a 25\% increase in net primary production and a 10\% decrease in export production globally. Consequently, the export ratio decreases from 17\% to 12\% in the model. The description of three zPFTs reduces model mismatches with observed dissolved inorganic nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations in the South Pacific and the Arctic Ocean, respectively. Representation of three zPFTs also strongly affects phytoplankton phenology: Fast nutrient recycling by zooplankton sustains higher chlorophyll concentrations in summer and autumn. Additional zooplankton grazing delays the start of the phytoplankton bloom by 3 weeks and controls the magnitude of the bloom peak in the Southern Ocean. As a result, the system switches from a light-controlled Sverdrup system to a dilution-controlled Behrenfeld system. Overall, the results suggest that representation of multiple zPFTs is important to capture underlying processes that may shape the response of ecosystems and ecosystem services to on-going and future environmental change in model projections.","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","English","Karakus, O (Corresponding Author), Helmholtz Zentrum Polar \& Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany.

Winter is one of the least studied seasons in Antarctica and we have limited understanding about the strategies Antarctic krill use to survive the winter. In particular, data on the winter physiology and condition of juvenile Antarctic krill are severely lacking. From May to September (the austral autumn-winter) of 2019, we maintained juvenile Antarctic krill in large (1,330 L) aquarium tanks at Palmer Station, Antarctica and, at monthly time intervals, measured their physiology and condition. Each tank served as a ``food environment scenario{''}, representing possible food environments the krill may encounter during winter along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. We found that, unlike adults, juvenile krill maintain relatively high respiration rates through the winter and respond positively to increased food concentrations by increasing their ingestion rates. Unlike larval krill, juveniles use lipid stores accumulated during the summer and autumn to sustain themselves through periods of starvation in the winter. We used our empirically derived measurements of physiology and condition to estimate the energy budget and growth potential of juvenile krill during the winter. We found that, given their comparatively high respiration rates, small juvenile krill (20 mg dry weight) would need to encounter food at concentrations of similar to 0.15 mg C L-1 daily to avoid loss of body carbon. Without sufficient lipid reserves, this value increases to similar to 0.54 mg C L-1, daily. The health of juvenile krill in the wintertime is dependent on their ability to accumulate lipid stores in the summer and autumn and to find sufficient food during the winter. Changes in food availability to Antarctic krill throughout the year may become problematic to juvenile krill in the future. Understanding the variability in the winter energy budget of juvenile Antarctic krill will allow us to improve population models that make assumptions on seasonal growth patterns.","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","English","Bernard, KS (Corresponding Author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.

Anthropogenic climate change, however, is likely to drive rearrangements in phytoplankton community composition with potential ramifications for the whole ecosystem. In general, phytoplankton communities dominated by large phytoplankton, i.e., diatoms, yield shorter, more efficient food chains than ecosystems supported by small phytoplankton. Guided by a large ensemble of Earth system model simulations run under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5), we present hypotheses for how anthropogenic climate change may drive shifts in phytoplankton community structure in two regions of the Southern Ocean: the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) region and the sea ice zone (SIZ). Though both Southern Ocean regions experience warmer ocean temperatures and increased advective iron flux under 21st century climate warming, the model simulates a proliferation of diatoms at the expense of small phytoplankton in the ACC, while the opposite patterns are evident in the SIZ. The primary drivers of simulated diatom increases in the ACC region include warming, increased iron supply, and reduced light from increased cloudiness. In contrast, simulated reductions in ice cover yield greater light penetration in the SIZ, generating a phenological advance in the bloom accompanied by a shift to more small phytoplankton that effectively consume available iron; the result is an overall increase in net primary production, but a decreasing proportion of diatoms. Changes of this nature may promote more efficient trophic energy transfer via copepods or krill in the ACC region, while ecosystem transfer efficiency in the SIZ may decline as small phytoplankton grow in dominance, possibly impacting marine food webs sustaining Antarctic marine predators. Despite the simplistic ecosystem representation in our model, our results point to a potential shift in the relative success of contrasting phytoplankton ecological strategies in different regions of the Southern Ocean, with ramifications for higher trophic levels.","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","English","Krumhardt, KM (Corresponding Author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate \& Global Dynam, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.

Long-term habitat alterations in krill due to climate change have been considered in recent decades. However, there is still a lack understanding about krill distribution. The MaxEnt model was used to forecast the suitable distribution area of krill for this study, which is based on data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project in its sixth phase (CMIP6) in the near future and far future. A total of 145 occurrence points and 15 environmental factors were selected to build the MaxEnt model. The current suitable habitat regions for krill were mostly detected in the western and central regions of the Cosmonaut Sea, which accounted for 10.07\% of the total area. The most important environmental variables that influenced krill distribution were minimum surface solar radiation downward (ssrdmin), the mean temperature (tem) and the mean northward velocity (v). In the near future and far future, the suitable area of krill was seen to decline under all shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), with the smallest reduction under SSP1-2.6 and the greatest reduction under SSP5-8.5. The suitable area for krill dropped quicker from the near future to the far future than the present to the near future. Krill habitats were expected to shift to the poles. The tem continued to rise in the future under all SSP scenarios, particularly under the high radiative forcing scenario. The increase in water temperature is the main reason for the decrease in suitable areas for Antarctic krill. Our results show the future distribution of krill in the future and provide a reasonable reference for the ecological protection policy of the Cosmonaut Sea.","ELSEVIER","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","Feng, JL (Corresponding Author), Tianjin Univ Sci \& Technol, Key Lab Marine Resource Chem \& Food Technol TUST, Tianjin 300457, Peoples R China.

These groups are consumers of microbes, primary and secondary producers, and are prey for fishes, cephalopods, seabirds, and marine mammals. In providing the link between microbes, primary production, and higher trophic levels these taxa influence energy flows, biological production and biomass, biogeochemical cycles, carbon flux and food web interactions thereby modulating the structure and functioning of ecosystems.

Global and local drivers of change are expected to affect the dynamics of key zooplankton species, which may have potentially profound and wide-ranging implications for Southern Ocean ecosystems and the services they provide. Here we assess the current understanding of the dominant metazoan zooplankton within the Southern Ocean, including Antarctic krill and other key euphausiid, copepod, salp and pteropod species.

Muscle fatty acids (FAs) of the spiny icefish Chaenodraco wilsoni collected from three areas in the Bransfield Strait (BS), northern Antarctic Peninsula during February-April 2016 give a good representation of their feeding variability. The compositions of 22:6n3 (DHA) and 20:5n3 (EPA) were both higher in the Transitional Zonal Water with Bellingshausen influence (TBW)-controlled C. wilsoni than in the Transitional Zonal Water with Weddell Sea influence (TWW)-controlled fish. This was positively correlated with photoadaptation and carbon sequestration in TBW-controlled phytoplankton. Results for the FAs 16:1n7, 16:0, DHA and EPA indicate the presence of dinoflagellates in all three areas, suggesting that during late summer and early fall, there is a seasonal phytoplankton succession, where small phytoplankton become dominant, in the BS. In addition, the compositions of some long-chain FAs (>20, such as 20:0, 20:1, 22:0 and 22:1n9) and n-ary sumation 18 indicated that the food chain based on flagellates and copepods was more apparent in TWW-controlled C. wilsoni, especially the effect of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the variation of prey communities in TWW-controlled areas. FA markers such as SFA/(PUFA+MUFA), n-ary sumation 15 + n-ary sumation 17 and ARA were more pronounced in TWW-controlled C. wilsoni, indicating a more strongly carnivorous and benthic food source. In the TBW-TWW confluence, the complex hydrological structure, including the presence of a large number of mesoscale eddies, allows rich nutrients and krill larvae to remain in it, providing a rich food source for the C. wilsoni. Overall, the FA data of this study show that the diet of C. wilsoni varies in different marine environments, aiding their survivability at the face of climate change.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Zhu, GP (Corresponding Author), Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.

For example, baleen whale populations are recovering from commercial harvesting against the backdrop of rapid climate change, including reduced sea ice extent and changing ecosystem composition. Concurrently, the commercial harvesting of Antarctic krill is increasing, with the potential to increase the likelihood for competition with and between krill predators and the fishery. However, understanding the ecology, abundance, and spatial distribution of krill predators is often limited, outdated, or at spatial scales that do not match those desired for effective fisheries management. We update current knowledge of predator dependence on krill by integrating telemetry-based data, at-sea observational surveys, estimates of predator abundance, and physiological data to estimate the spatial distribution of krill consumption during the austral summer by three species of Pygoscelis penguin, 11 species of flying seabirds, one species of pinniped, and two species of baleen whale. Our models show that the majority of important areas for krill predator foraging are close to penguin breeding colonies in nearshore areas where humpback whales also regularly feed, and along the shelf-break, though we caution that not all known krill predators are included in these analyses. We show that krill consumption is highly variable across the region, and often concentrated at fine spatial scales, emphasizing the need for the management of the local krill fishery at relevant temporal and spatial scales. We also note that krill consumption by recovering populations of krill predators provides further evidence in support of the krill surplus hypothesis, and highlight that despite less than comprehensive data, cetaceans are likely to consume a significant proportion of the krill consumed by natural predators but are not currently considered directly in the management of the krill fishery. If management of the krill fishery is to be precautionary and operate in a way that minimizes the risks to krill predator populations, it will be necessary in future analyses, to include up-to-date and precise abundance and consumption estimates for pack-ice seals, finfish, squid, and other baleen whale species not currently considered.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Warwick-Evans, V (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England.

One of the least disturbed sites anywhere within the Southern Ocean and one where krill fishing has so far been virtually non-existent is the South Sandwich Islands volcanic archipelago. Some of the main krill predators breeding at the South Sandwich Islands are penguins, with five species breeding on the islands, the dominant species of which is the chinstrap penguin. In this paper we report on the results of ARGOS PTT deployments during the chinstrap penguin chick-rearing period, using the recorded foraging trips to develop habitat models. Foraging habitats used by chinstrap penguins during this period were best characterised by distance from the colony and sea surface temperature and, using these two covariates, we predicted the chick-rearing foraging habitat use around all islands. We show that the provisions of the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area ensure that chinstrap penguins, and other krill-dependent predators with similar foraging ranges, likely have robust protection during the summer. During the winter, when krill predators are likely to forage further offshore, seasonal sea ice provides a physical barrier to exclude the fishery, again ensuring the islands??? unique biodiversity receives strong protection. However, to the north of the marginal sea ice zone, competition between krill predators and the fishery could exist if the fishery were ever to explore new locations for resource extraction. We make a number of conclusions, including the need for winter tracking data to inform future management options.","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","English","Clucas, GV (Corresponding Author), Cornell Univ, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.

Feeding grounds at polar regions are currently experiencing major ecosystem modifications, therefore, quantitatively assessing species responses to habitat characteristics is crucial for understanding how whales might respond to such modifications. We analyzed satellite telemetry data from 22 individual humpback whales in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWA). Tagging effort was divided in two periods, 2003-2012 and 2016-2019. Correlations between whale's movement parameters and environmental variables were used as proxy for inferring behavioral responses to environmental variation. Two versions of a covariate-driven continuous-time correlated random-walk state-space model, were fitted to the data: i) Population-level models (P-models), which assess correlation parameters pooling data across all individuals or groups, and ii) individual-level models (I-models), fitted independently for each tagged whale. Area of Restricted Search behavior (slower and less directionally persistent movement, ARS) was concentrated at cold waters south of the Polar Front (similar to 50 degrees S). The best model showed that ARS was expected to occur in coastal areas and over ridges and seamounts. Ice coverage during August of each year was a consistent predictor of ARS across models. Wind stress curl and sea surface temperature anomalies were also correlated with movement parameters but elicited larger inter-individual variation. I-models were consistent with P-models' predictions for the case of females accompanied by calves (mothers), while males and those of undetermined sex (males +) presented more variability as a group. Spatial predictions of humpback whale behavioral responses showed that feeding grounds for this population are concentrated in the complex system of islands, ridges, and rises of the Scotia Sea and the northern Weddell Ridge. More southernly incursions were observed in recent years, suggesting a potential response to increased temperature and large ice coverage reduction observed in the late 2010s. Although, small sample size and differences in tracking duration precluded appropriately testing predictions for such a distributional shift, our modelling framework showed the efficiency of borrowing statistical strength during data pooling, while pinpointing where more complexity should be added in the future as additional data become available.","NATURE PORTFOLIO","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","English","Bedrinana-Romano, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Marinas \& Limnol, Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile.

At present, the suitable distribution is unobtainable by scientific surveys or data from the fishery. In this paper, the maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent) was used to obtain the potential distribution of adult Antarctic krill in order to provide useful information and reasonable reference for the policy on protecting potential krill habitats around the Amundsen Sea. Occurrence points and 17 environmental variables were used to simulate the distributions. Results show that the high and moderate suitable habitats lie between 65 degrees S and 72 degrees S in the Amundsen Sea. The high suitable habitat accounts for 8.1\% of the total area of the Amundsen Sea. The sea ice persistence (ICE), total phytoplankton (PHYC), and the minimum value of dissolved iron (Fe\_min) are the three dominant contributors to the model. Results from the response curves show that Antarctic krill preferred habitats with ICE of 0.42-0.93, PHYC of 2.48-2.77 mmol/m(3) and Fe\_min of (7.10x10(-5))-(9.45x10(-5)) mmol/m(3). Positive trends existed in the PHYC of the high and moderate suitable habitat, and a positive trend existed in the Fe\_min of moderate suitable habitat. However, the probability of presence of Antarctic krill will decrease if the increase of the PHYC and Fe\_min continues.","SCIENCE PRESS","16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, Building 5, Room 411, BEIJING, 100009, PEOPLES R CHINA","English","Zhao, L (Corresponding Author), Tianjin Univ Sci \& Technol, Key Lab Marine Resource Chem \& Food Technol TUST, Minist Educ, Tianjin 300457, Peoples R China.

Krill are an important component of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, providing a key food source for many marine predators. Additionally, krill are the target of the largest commercial fishery in the Southern Ocean, for which annual catches have been increasing and concentrating in recent years. The krill fishery is managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which has endorsed a new management framework that requires information about the spatial distribution and biomass of krill. Here, we use krill density estimates from acoustic surveys and a GAMM framework to model habitat properties associated with high krill biomass during summer and winter in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region, an area important to the commercial fishery. Our models show elevated krill density associated with the shelf break, increased sea surface temperature, moderate chlorophyll-a concentration and increased salinity. During winter, our models show associations with shallow waters (< 1500 m) with low sea-ice concentration, medium sea-level anomaly and medium current speed. Our models predict temporal averages of the distribution and density of krill, which can be used to aid CCAMLR's revised ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Our models have the potential to help in the spatial and temporal design of future acoustic surveys that would preclude the need for modelled extrapolations.

In this region, humpback whales migrate annually from their winter breeding grounds off the coast of Brazil to their summer feeding grounds near to the Polar Front, an area that includes the waters of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI). This latter region includes a Marine Protected Area (MPA), which has been developed to ensure sustainable management of fisheries, and protection of foraging predators. To date, management measures within the MPA have primarily been concerned with foraging predators that rely upon Antarctic krill, including for a number of previously over-exploited species. With humpback whales increasing in the western South Atlantic, understandingnderstanding their spatiotemporal distribution within the MPA is important as it will help inform management particularly in respect of interactions between humpback whales and the regional fishery for Antarctic krill. Here we develop habitat models from the distribution and movement patterns of 16 individuals at their high-latitude feeding grounds, south of 50 degrees S. We show that whale habitat use varies throughout the foraging period. Upon reaching their feeding ground, whales use the area to the east of the South Sandwich Islands, moving westward into the centre of the Scotia Arc and towards South Georgia during the high summer, and then expanding back towards the east in the winter. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for the future, including necessary research required for underpinning management.","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","English","Bamford, CCG (Corresponding Author), Nat Environm Res Council NERC, British Antarctic Survey, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

Biomagnification of Hg in the food web of the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the world's fastest-warming regions, was examined using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios for estimating feeding habitat and trophic levels, respectively. The stable isotope signatures and total Hg (T-Hg) concentrations were measured in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and several Antarctic predator species, including seabirds (gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua, chinstrap penguins Pygoscelis antarcticus, brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus, kelp gulls Larus dominicanus, southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus) and marine mammals (southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina). Significant differences in delta C-13 values among species were noted with a great overlap between seabird species and M. leonina. As expected, significant differences in delta N-15 values among species were found due to interspecific variations in diet-related to their trophic position within the marine food web. The lowest Hg concentrations were registered in E. superba (0.007 +/- 0.008 mu g g(-1)) and the highest values in M. giganteus (12.090 +/- 14.177 mu g g(-1)). Additionally, a significant positive relationship was found between Hg concentrations and trophic levels (reflected by delta N-15 values), biomagnifying nearly 2 times its concentrations at each level. Our results support that trophic interaction is the major pathway for Hg biomagnification in Southern Ocean ecosystems and warn about an increase in the effects of Hg on long-lived (and high trophic level) Antarctic predators under climate change in the future.","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","English","Matias, RS (Corresponding Author), Univ Coimbra, Mare Marine \& Environm Sci Ctr, Dept Life Sci, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal.

During the last glacial stage, Antarctic sea ice was more extensive than today, but uncertainties in geological (marine sediments), glaciological (ice core), and climate model reconstructions of past sea-ice extent continue to limit our understanding of its role in the Earth system. Here, we present a novel archive of past sea-ice environments from regurgitated stomach oils of snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) preserved at nesting sites in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica. We show that by combining information from fatty acid distributions and their stable carbon isotope ratios with measurements of bulk carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and trace metal data, it is possible to reconstruct changing snow petrel diet within Marine Isotope Stage 2 (ca. 24.3-30.3 cal kyr BP). We show that, as today, a mixed diet of krill and fish characterizes much of the record. However, between 27.4 and 28.7 cal kyr BP signals of krill almost disappear. By linking dietary signals in the stomach-oil deposits to modern feeding habits and foraging ranges, we infer the use by snow petrels of open-water habitats ({''}polynyas{''}) in the sea ice during our interval of study. The periods when consumption of krill was reduced are interpreted to correspond to the opening of polynyas over the continental shelf, which became the preferred foraging habitat. Our results show that extensive, thick, and multiyear sea ice was not always present close to the continent during the last glacial stage and highlight the potential of stomach-oil deposits as a palaeoenvironmental archive of Southern Ocean conditions.","COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","English","McClymont, EL (Corresponding Author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.

The species lives in coastal environments which are currently susceptible to shifts in temperature and productivity. Due to its abundance, it sustains many inshore fisheries and, for this reason, determining the potential outcome of future changes in sea temperature and productivity for Nyctiphanes is important. The temperature-and food-dependence of growth and reproduction of Nyctiphanes species can be made through Dynamic Energy Budget models (DEB), developed here to quantify how temperature and food availability affects growth, fecundity, egg size, and the energetic content of the eggs throughout the krill life-span. The DEB model predictions are in good agreement with measured life-history traits for the species and show that krill grows slower during winter while females do not always reach sexual maturity when temperatures are below 8 C and food levels are low. We found that higher temperatures and low food levels decrease the energetic content and diameter of the eggs by similar to 20\%, affecting the length and age at which N. australis commence reproduction. Under current scenarios of future ocean warming, these results indicate that populations of N. australis are likely to decline, with potential knock-on effects on coastal marine ecosystems and inshore fisheries.","ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND","English","Lagos, PF (Corresponding Author), Univ Otago, Dept Marine Sci, 310 Castle St, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand.

Planktivorous short-tailed shearwaters Ardenna tenuirostris (66\% of total seabirds) and piscivorous rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata (28\%) were predominant, but foraged in contrasting habitats. A large foraging flock of shearwaters was observed in the cold-water belt zone, including its front with coastal Soya Warm Current Water and the offshore Fresh Surface Okhotsk Sea Water, where surface chlorophyll a concentrations were the highest but not related to their prey (zooplankton) biomass at any spatial scale between 4.6 and 9.2 km. In contrast, the density of auklets was high in the coastal Soya Warm Current Water, where the acoustically determined fish biomass was large, and showed a positive relationship with the fish biomass especially in the lower layer (29-104 m depth) at any spatial scale. This species-specific difference in response to prey biomass might be related to prey-searching behaviors; i.e., rhinoceros auklets search prey underwater visually, but short-tailed shearwater can use both visual and olfactory cues to locate zooplankton patches from the air.","SPRINGER JAPAN KK","SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN","English","Nishizawa, B (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Polar Res, Midori Cho 10-3, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan.

Global mesopelagic fish biomass estimates are increasingly derived using active acoustics, where echosounder-generated signals are emitted, reflected by pelagic organisms and detected by transducers on vessels. Previous studies have interpreted a ubiquitous decline in acoustic reflectance towards the Antarctic continent as a reduction in mesopelagic fish biomass. Here, we use empirical data to estimate species-specific acoustic target strength for the dominant mesopelagic fish of the Scotia Sea in the Southern Ocean. We use these data, alongside estimates of fish relative abundance from net surveys, to interpret signals received in acoustic surveys and calculate mesopelagic biomass of the broader Southern Ocean. We estimate the Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish biomass to be approximately 274 million tonnes if Antarctic krill contribute to the acoustic signal, or 570 million tonnes if mesopelagic fish alone are responsible. These quantities are approximately 1.8 and 3.8 times greater than previous net-based biomass estimates. We also show a peak in fish biomass towards the seasonal ice-edge, corresponding to the preferred feeding grounds of penguins and seals, which may be at risk under future climate change scenarios. Our study provides new insights into the abundance and distributions of ecologically significant mesopelagic fish stocks across the Southern Ocean ecosystem.","ROYAL SOC","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","English","Dornan, T (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

Understanding such changes in allocation is integral to determining the nutritional quality of diatoms and the subsequent impacts on the trophic transfer of energy and nutrients. Using synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, we analysed the macromolecular content of selected individual diatom taxa from a natural Antarctic phytoplankton community exposed to a gradient of fCO(2) levels (288-1263 mu atm). Strong species-specific differences in macromolecular partitioning were observed under OA. Large taxa showed preferential energy allocation towards proteins, while smaller taxa increased both lipid and protein stores at high fCO(2). If these changes are representative of future Antarctic diatom physiology, we may expect a shift away from lipid-rich large diatoms towards a community dominated by smaller taxa, but with higher lipid and protein stores than their present-day contemporaries, a response that could have cascading effects on food web dynamics in the Antarctic marine ecosystem.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Petrou, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.

In the current study, we collected E. superba specimens (including muscle and carapace tissues) from Bransfield Strait in northern Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia to analyze the profile, influencing factors and mechanisms of OCPs bioaccumulation in them. Results indicated that the biological traits (813C, 815N and lipid contents) of krill were significantly affected by habitat. There may exist growth dilution of OCPs in Antarctic krill and no fresh OCPs input in Antarctica, except for endosulfan I. Based on lipid-normalized concentrations, no significant differences were observed between the two regions at most sampling sites. However, OCP levels showed tissue and sex dependence. Boosted regression trees (BRTs) and partial least squares structural equation models (PLS-SEMs) were built to better investigate the main factors affecting the bioaccumulation of OCPs. Lipid content, negatively correlated with OCP levels, was the main factor. In vitro silicon modeling indicated that CYP3A4 metabolism capacity in krill contributed to the OCP residues except for endosulfan I. The results of this study expand current knowledge of OCPs in Antarctic marine biota, as well as their influencing factors and potential mechanisms.","ELSEVIER","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","Li, YM (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Chem \& Ecotoxicol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.

The majority of SDMs are static, relating species presence information to long-term average environmental conditions. The resulting temporal mismatch between species information and environmental conditions can increase model inference's uncertainty. For SDMs to capture the dynamic species-environment relationships and predict near-real-time habitat suitability, species information needs to be spatiotemporally matched with environmental conditions contemporaneous to the species' presence (dynamic SDMs). Implementing dynamic SDMs in the marine realm is highly challenging, particularly due to species and environmental data paucity and spatiotemporally biases. Here, we implemented presence-only dynamic SDMs for four migratory baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean (SO): Antarctic minke, Antarctic blue, fin, and humpback whales. Sightings were spatiotemporally matched with their respective daily environmental predictors. Background information was sampled daily to describe the dynamic environmental conditions in the highly dynamic SO. We corrected for spatial sampling bias by sampling background information respective to the seasonal research efforts. Independent model evaluation was performed on spatial and temporal cross-validation. We predicted the circumantarctic year-round habitat suitability of each species. Daily predictions were also summarized into bi-weekly and monthly habitat suitability. We identified important predictors and species suitability responses to environmental changes. Our results support the propitious use of dynamic SDMs to fill species information gaps and improve conservation planning strategies. Near-real-time predictions can be used for dynamic ocean management, e.g., to examine the overlap between habitat suitability and human activities. Nevertheless, the inevitable spatiotemporal biases in sighting data from the SO call for the need for improving sampling effort in the SO and using alternative data sources (e.g., passive acoustic monitoring) in future SDMs. We further discuss challenges of calibrating dynamic SDMs on baleen whale species in the SO, with a particular focus on spatiotemporal sampling bias issues and how background information should be sampled in presence-only dynamic SDMs. We also highlight the need to integrate visual and acoustic data in future SDMs on baleen whales for better coverage of environmental conditions suitable for the species and avoid constraints of using either data type alone.","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","English","El-Gabbas, A (Corresponding Author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar \& Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst AWI, Ocean Acoust Grp, Bremerhaven, Germany.

Moving poleward might be easier in the Arctic than in the Southern Ocean, where evidence for range shifts is sparse and contradictory. Here, we compiled a database of larval Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba and, together with an adult database, it showed how their range shift is out of step with the pace of warming. During a 70-year period of rapid warming (1920s-1990s), distribution centres of both larvae and adults in the SW Atlantic sector remained fixed, despite warming by 0.5-1.0 degrees C and losing sea ice. This was followed by a hiatus in surface warming and ice loss, yet during this period the distributions of krill life stages shifted greatly, by similar to 1000 km, to the south-west. Understanding the mechanism of such step changes is essential, since they herald system reorganizations that are hard to predict with current modelling approaches. We propose that the abrupt shift was driven by climatic controls acting on localized recruitment hotspots, superimposed on thermal niche conservatism. During the warming hiatus, the Southern Annular Mode index continued to become increasingly positive and, likely through reduced feeding success for larvae, this led to a precipitous decline in recruitment from the main reproduction hotspot along the southern Scotia Arc. This cut replenishment to the northern portion of the krill stock, as evidenced by declining density and swarm frequency. Concomitantly, a new, southern reproduction area developed after the 1990s, reinforcing the range shift despite the lack of surface warming. New spawning hotspots may provide the stepping stones needed for range shifts into polar regions, so planning of climate-ready marine protected areas should include these key areas of future habitat.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Atkinson, A (Corresponding Author), Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.

Krill has the potential to contribute approximately 10\% to all future marine landings, adding significantly to global food security. However, the fishery is effectively data-limited so is currently managed using precautionary assess-ments that relate to large spatial and temporal scales that preclude the need for fine-scale ecological data. To respond to recent changes in fishery operation and to mitigate possible ecological impacts, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) plans to revise its management strategy so that it takes into account ecosystem operation at smaller spatial and temporal scales, such as those relevant to krill-dependent predators. Here, we consider how catches in coastal areas potentially present challenges for these predators, where cumulative catches over the fishing season can sometimes be greater than local consumption by predators, and sometimes greater than the standing stock of krill within an area because of krill transport and replenishment by ocean currents. Protecting feeding areas used by land-based predators such as penguins and seals, whilst also offering a high level of protection for pelagic predators such as some species of fish and recovering populations of cetaceans, will require innovative solutions. We highlight critical ecological research needed to reduce management uncertainty. This is important as we demonstrate that krill consumption by predators in near-shore coastal habitats relies absolutely upon krill movement and oceanographic transport. We also highlight the need to improve understanding about krill behaviour, especially in relation to observed seasonal changes in krill biomass. Finally, we highlight that without up-to-date data about changes in krill, krill-dependent predator populations and their oceanographic environ-ment, management will remain challenging in the context of increasing fishing pressure, recovering populations of marine mammals and a changing climate.","ELSEVIER","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","Trathan, PN (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) inhabiting the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean prey largely on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and play a central role in managing the krill fishery. Here, we assessed the demographic structure of three post-mating, early moult male haul-outs in the South Shetland Islands in early March and calculated the relative contribution of juveniles (1-4 years old) and sub-adult males (5-6 years) to the population remaining in maritime Antarctica after the breeding season. We also satellite tagged 11 juvenile males and four sub-adult males to analyze their movements and develop a species distribution model including both age classes. Our results highlighted the dominance of young individuals in the male population, revealed that they do not behave as central place foragers and identified key environmental drivers that affected their distribution at-sea throughout winter. Predicted potential foraging habitat overlapped highly with the known distribution of Antarctic krill, and identified the waters off the western Antarctic Peninsula and the Scotia Sea as the core of the distribution area of juvenile and sub-adult male Antarctic fur seals in winter. This pattern is similar to that of adult males but totally different from that of adult females, as the latter overwinter in areas at latitude 45-55 degrees S. This segregation has implications for the ecology and management of the krill fishery.","NATURE PORTFOLIO","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","English","March, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, IRBio, Avinguda Diagonal 643, Barcelona 08028, Spain.

In the past decade, the spatial distribution of the krill fishery has focused on the Bransfield Strait off the Antarctic Peninsula (subarea 48.1). However, the high fishing effort and climate change have placed great pressure on krill resources in this region, and conservation concerns have been raised. Because aging krill is difficult and uncertain, we developed an integrated size-structured model to estimate the fishing mortality, recruitment and spawning biomass of krill. The results indicated that in 1992-2011, the average spawning biomass of krill ranged from 1.14 x 10(6) to 1.45 x 10(6) tons, the estimated biomass of the maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) ranged from 3.96 x 10(5) to 4.90 x 10(5) tons and the estimated average recruitment ranged from 2.3 x 10(12) to 5.03 x 10(12) individuals in the research area. We explored the effect of different data weighting schemes for the length data on the assessment output. However, our estimates also have uncertainties. In addition, an attempt was made to analyze the correlation between model-estimated recruitment and mature biomass with climate change. Future stock assessments of krill resources should be comprehensive and multimethod, and the management of krill resources should be based on science that considers the demand of fishing communities and ecosystem protection.","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","English","Li, Y; Lin, LS (Corresponding Author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 3, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China.

By analyzing a five-decade (1971-2017) data series of individual southern right whales (SRWs; Eubalaena australis) photo-identified at Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, we found a marked increase in whale mortality rates following El Nino events. By modeling how the population responds to changes in the frequency and intensity of El Nino events, we found that such events are likely to impede SRW population recovery and could even cause population decline. Such outcomes have the potential to disrupt food-web interactions in the SO, weakening that ecosystem's contribution to the mitigation of climate change at a global scale.","AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE","1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA","English","Agrelo, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Ecol \& Zool, Lab Mamiferos Aquat, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.

We use a unique data set of Weddell Leptonychotes weddellii and crabeater seals' (CESs) Lobodon carcinophaga breeding season distribution in the Weddell Sea, determined from satellite imagery. We contrast the theoretical climate impacts on both ice-obligate predators who differ in life-history characteristics: CESs are highly specialized Antarctic krill Euphausia superba predators and breed in the seasonal pack ice; Weddell seals (WESs) are generalist predators and breed on comparatively stable fast ice. We used presence-absence data and a suite of remotely sensed environmental variables to build habitat models. Each of the environmental predictors is multiplied by a `climate change score' based on known responses to climate change to create a `change importance product'. Results show CESs are more sensitive to climate change than WESs. Crabeater seals prefer to breed close to krill, and the compounding effects of changing sea ice concentrations and sea surface temperatures, the proximity to krill and abundance of stable breeding ice, can influence their post-breeding foraging success and ultimately their future breeding success. But in contrast to the Ross Sea, here WESs prefer to breed closer to larger colonies of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). This suggests that the Weddell Sea may currently be prey-abundant, allowing the only two air-breathing Antarctic silverfish predators (Pleuragramma antarctica) (WESs and emperor penguins) to breed closer to each other. This is the first basin-scale, region-specific comparison of breeding season habitat in these two key Antarctic predators based on real-world data to compare climate change responses. This work shows that broad-brush, basin-scale approaches to understanding species-specific responses to climate change are not always appropriate, and regional models are needed-especially when designing marine protected areas.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Wege, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Canterbury, Sch Earth \& Environm, Gateway Antarct, Christchurch, New Zealand.

Endemic Nototheniinae is the dominant fish group found in Antarctic marine habitats. Through their intermediate position within the food web, Nototheniinae link lower to higher trophic levels and thereby also form an important component of parasite life cycles. The study was set out to gain insight into the parasite fauna of Nototheniops larseni, N. nudifrons and Lepidonotothen squamifrons (Nototheniinae) from Elephant Island (Antarctica). Methods Sampling was conducted at three locations around Elephant Island during the ANT-XXVIII/4 expedition of the research vessel Polarstern. The parasite fauna of three Nototheniine species was analysed, and findings were compared to previous parasitological and ecological research collated from a literature review. Results All host species shared the parasites Neolebouria antarctica (Digenea), Corynosoma bullosum (Acanthocephala) and Pseudoterranova decipiens E (Nematoda). Other parasite taxa were exclusive to one host species in this study. Nototheniops nudifrons was infected by Ascarophis nototheniae (Nematoda), occasional infections of N. larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi (Acanthocephala) and L. squamifrons with Elytrophalloides oatesi (Digenea) and larval tetraphyllidean Cestoda were detected. Conclusion All examined fish species' parasites were predominantly euryxenous regarding their fish hosts. The infection of Lepidonotothen squamifrons with Lepidapedon garrardi (Digenea) and Nototheniops larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi represent new host records. Despite the challenges and limited opportunities for fishing in remote areas, future studies should continue sampling on a more regular basis and include a larger number of fish species and sampling sites within different habitats.","SPRINGER INT PUBL AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","Alt, KG (Corresponding Author), Goethe Univ, Inst Ecol Evolut \& Divers, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.

To date, the potential implications of this population shift on the biogeochemical cycling of the limiting micronutrient iron (Fe) and its bioavailability to SO phytoplankton has never been tested. Based on uptake of fecal pellet (FP)released Fe by SO phytoplankton, this study highlights how efficiently krill and salps recycle Fe. To test this, we collected FPs of natural populations of salps and krill, added them to the same SO phytoplankton community, andmeasured the community's Fe uptake rates. Our results reveal that both FP additions yielded similar dissolved iron concentrations in the seawater. Per FP carbon added to the seawater, 4.8 +/- 1.5 times more Fe was taken up by the same phytoplankton community from salp FP than from krill FP, suggesting that salp FP increased the Fe bioavailability, possibly through the release of ligands. With respect to the ongoing shift from krill to salps, the potential for carbon fixation of the Fe-limited SO could be strengthened in the future, representing a negative feedback to climate change.","CELL PRESS","50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","English","Bockmann, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Bremen, Marine Bot, Bibliothekstr 1, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.

The Antarctic Peninsula supports high densities of krill and krill consumers; however, the region is warming rapidly, with unknown consequences. Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis are the largest krill consumers here, yet key data gaps remain about their distribution, behavior, and interactions and how these will be impacted by changing conditions. Using satellite telemetry and novel spatial point-process modeling techniques, we quantified habitat use of each species relative to dynamic environmental variables and determined overlap in core habitat areas during summer months when sea ice is at a minimum. We found that humpback whales ranged broadly over continental shelf waters, utilizing nearshore bays, while minke whales restricted their movements to sheltered bays and areas where ice is present. This presents a scenario where minke whale core habitat overlaps substantially with the broader home ranges of humpback whales. While there is no indication that prey is limiting in this ecosystem, increased overlap between these species may arise as climate-driven changes that affect the extent, timing, and duration of seasonal sea ice decrease the amount of preferred foraging habitat for minke whales while concurrently increasing it for humpback whales. Our results provide the first quantitative assessment of behaviorally based habitat use and sympatry between these 2 krill consumers and offers insight into the potential effects of a rapidly changing environment on the structure and function of a polar ecosystem.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Friedlaender, AS (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, 115 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.

The western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) is home to a significant proportion of the circum-Antarctic krill biomass and is the focus of the krill fishery. The wAP is warming at a rate quicker than most other places on Earth, with notable regional changes in the pelagic ecosystem. There is a major gap in our understanding of how environmental variability affects the reproductive success of krill. We used historical krill population data collected at the wAP (January 1993-2008, Palmer Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research) to assess the effects of environmental variability on the condition of mature female krill during the spawning season and its relationship with krill recruitment. Mature female krill condition during the spawning season was positively correlated with recruitment the subsequent year. Results of generalized additive models indicated that the predominant drivers of krill condition during the spawning season were climatological (Southern Annular Mode and Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index), though the timing of sea ice advance and retreat, and diatom concentrations were also important Gaining a better understanding of the oceanographic and climatological factors that affect the physiological condition of mature female krill is critical for predicting future demographic patterns and responses to change.

Therefore, they can compete with krill for primary production. Over the last three decades, significant variability in S. thompsoni occurrence has been observed as a response to the environmental fluctuations of the Southern Ocean ecosystem (e.g. changes in sea surface temperature and ice-cover shrinkage around the cold Antarctic waters). This study presents historical abundance data of salps from the south-west Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean, covering a time span of 26 years. These data allow tracking of fluctuations in Antarctic salp abundance and their distribution with bottom depth, temperature, and ice conditions, aiming to reveal salp hot spots and to predict the future range of S. thompsoni distribution with upcoming climate warming in the next 50 years. Results showed the highest salp density in shallow shelf waters with ice cover and low temperatures between 1 and -1 degrees C. In the studied area, S. thompsoni hot spots were located mostly around Elephant Island, but also the islands around Brensfield and Gerlache Straits, as well as to the south near the Bellingshausen Sea. Inferences made of future salp distribution suggest that the range of S. thompsoni will move southwards, enlarging their habitat area by nearly 500,000 km(2), which may have significant implications on the whole Antarctic food web. The information presented herein may be used for Antarctic ecosystem management, protection, and conservation.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Slomska, AW (Corresponding Author), Univ Gdansk, Fac Oceanog \& Geog, Dept Marine Plankton Res, 46 MJ Pilsudskiego Ave, PL-81378 Gdynia, Pomorskie, Poland.

Identifying sea-ice characteristics that serve as indicators of habitat quality will be crucial to the monitoring and management of climate change impacts. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill is a key prey species and fishery target. Krill larvae depend upon sea-ice habitats to survive the winter and recruit to the population in spring. Existing observations of sea-ice characteristics lack sufficient spatiotemporal coverage to quantify which ones contribute to favourable overwintering habitat, leading to uncertainties in how current and future changes in sea ice affect krill populations. Here, we derive regional-scale indices of annual krill recruitment spanning 35 years across the southwest Atlantic. To develop meaningful indicators of sea-ice habitat, we selected variables from a high-resolution sea-ice model that are hypothesized as relevant for larval habitat use. The resulting correlations between recruitment and sea-ice indicators vary by region and show remote connections to sea ice that correspond with established theories of larval transport. Through an improved representation of sea-ice habitat quality, as compared with using more traditional satellite-derived variables such as sea-ice extent and duration, we highlight plausible regions of overwintering habitat. Our findings improve current understanding of how krill are likely responding to changing sea ice and support emerging views that larval habitat use is complex. Furthermore, regional variation in larval dependence on sea ice may provide pockets of resilience to change for the broader krill population.","ELSEVIER","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","Veytia, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine \& Antarctic Studies, 20 Castray Esp, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia.

Toward understanding krill's response to environmental change, it is necessary to identify regions that support high krill larval production (spawning habitat). We develop a mechanistic model combining thermal and food requirements for krill egg production, with predation pressure post-spawning, to predict regions of high-quality spawning habitat. We optimize our model regionally and generate circumpolar predictions of spawning habitat quality. Our results indicate the southwest Atlantic accounts for almost half of all predicted high-quality spawning habitat. Small-scale management units (SSMUs) around the Antarctic Peninsula had high coverage of high-quality spawning habitat. In contrast, the remaining SSMUs (except around South Georgia) were poorly covered, suggestive of population sinks reliant on input from external sources upstream. This implies strong potential for downstream impacts of fishing in key spawning areas, with implications for management of SSMUs and the krill fishery.","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","English","Green, DB (Corresponding Author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine \& Antarct Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.

Krill are a critical element of Southern Ocean ecosystems as well as biogeochemical cycles, while also supporting an international commercial fishery. In addition to trends forced by global-scale, human-driven warming, the Southern Ocean is highly dynamic, displaying large fluctuations in surface climate on interannual to decadal timescales. The dual roles of forced climate change and natural variability affecting Antarctic krill habitat, and therefore productivity, complicate interplay of observed trends and contribute to uncertainty in future projections. We use the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) coupled with an empirically derived model of krill growth to detect and attribute trends associated with ``forced,{'' human-driven climate change, distinguishing these from variability arising naturally. The forced trend in krill growth is characterized by a poleward contraction of optimal conditions and an overall reduction in Southern Ocean krill habitat. However, the amplitude of natural climate variability is relatively large, such that the forced trend cannot be formally distinguished from natural variability at local scales over much of the Southern Ocean by 2100. Our results illustrate how natural variability is an important driver of regional krill growth trends and can mask the forced trend until late in the 21st century. Given the ecological and commercial global importance of krill, this research helps inform current and future Southern Ocean krill management in the context of climate variability and change.","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","English","Sylvester, ZT (Corresponding Author), Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.

The isotopic niche is reflected by the ecological position and functional role of a species, which can be altered depending on these environmental changes. We assessed the isotopic niche and trophic positions (TP) of 3 seabirds on the Barton Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, to understand ecological interaction among the species. The average TP of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) (hereafter ``krill{''}) (2.6 +/- 0.1) was estimated by using the compiled published data of the compound-specific nitrogen isotope ratio of glutamic acid and phenylalanine in the Southern Ocean, and TP values of the seabirds based on that of krill to be reliable according to ecological knowledge. Our results on the overlap of the isotopic niches of seabirds suggests potential diet competition among the consumers, such as the brown skua (Stercorarius antarcticus) and south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), whereas the distinct and broad isotopic niche width of kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) suggesting that their adaptation through generalization was related to their extended habitat and various food sources. Our research indicates that isotopic niche of seabirds reflects their survival strategy for food competition. Consequently, these seabirds can be easily influenced by alternative food sources, including terrestrial and human-derived sources, by rapid environmental changes, indicating that they are valuable as key environmental species and require long-term monitoring in the Antarctic Peninsula.","ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND","English","Kim, JH; Ha, SY (Corresponding Author), Korea Polar Res Inst, Incheon 21990, South Korea.

The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is aware of the urgent need to develop climate-responsive options within its ecosystem approach to management. However, limited capacity as well as political differences have meant that little progress has been made. Strengthening scientific information flow to inform CCAMLR's decision-making on climate change may help to remove some of these barriers. On this basis, this study encourages the utilisation of outputs from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC's 2019 Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) constitutes the most rigorous and up-todate assessment of how oceans and the cryosphere are changing, how they are projected to change, and the consequences of those changes, together with a range of response options. To assist CCAMLR to focus on what is most useful from this extensive global report, SROCC findings that have specific relevance to the management of Southern Ocean ecosystems are extracted and summarised here. These findings are translated into recommendations to CCAMLR, emphasising the need to reduce and manage the risks that climate change presents to harvested species and the wider ecosystem of which they are part. Improved linkages between IPCC, CCAMLR and other relevant bodies may help overcome existing impediments to progress, enabling climate change to become fully integrated into CCAMLR's policy and decision-making.","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","English","Cavanagh, RD (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

Satellite observations suggest that phytoplankton biomass in the mixed-layer has increased over the last 20 years in most (but not all) parts of the Southern Ocean, whereas primary production at the base of the mixed-layer has likely decreased over the same period. Different satellite models of primary production (Vertically Generalised versus Carbon Based Production Models) give different patterns and directions of recent change in net primary production (NPP). At present, the satellite record is not long enough to distinguish between trends and climate-related cycles in primary production. Over the next 100 years, Earth system models project increasing NPP in the water column in the MEASO northern and Antarctic zones but decreases in the Subantarctic zone. Low confidence in these projections arises from: (1) the difficulty in mapping supply mechanisms for key nutrients (silicate, iron); and (2) understanding the effects of multiple stressors (including irradiance, nutrients, temperature, pCO(2), pH, grazing) on different species of Antarctic phytoplankton.

We hypothesized that sea ice provides additional benefits because it hosts fewer competitors and provides reduced predation risk for krill larvae than the water column. To test our hypothesis, zooplankton were sampled in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone at the ice-water interface (0-2 m) and in the water column (0-500 m) during August-October 2013. Grazing by mesozooplankton, expressed as a percentage of the phytoplankton standing stock, was higher in the water column (1.97 +/- 1.84\%) than at the ice-water interface (0.08 +/- 0.09\%), due to a high abundance of pelagic copepods. Predation risk by carnivorous macrozooplankton, expressed as a percentage of the mesozooplankton standing stock, was significantly lower at the ice-water interface (0.83 +/- 0.57\%; main predators amphipods, siphonophores and ctenophores) than in the water column (4.72 +/- 5.85\%; main predators chaetognaths and medusae). These results emphasize the important role of sea ice as a suitable winter habitat for larval krill with fewer competitors and lower predation risk. These benefits should be taken into account when considering the response of Antarctic krill to projected declines in sea ice. Whether reduced sea-ice algal production may be compensated for by increased water column production remains unclear, but the shelter provided by sea ice would be significantly reduced or disappear, thus increasing the predation risk on krill larvae.","SPRINGER","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","English","David, CL (Corresponding Author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Zentrum Polar \& Meeresforsch AWI, Handelshafen 12, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.

Experiments during 2 summer field seasons at Palmer Station, Antarctica, investigated the independent and interactive effects of elevated temperature and pCO(2) (decreased pH) on feeding, growth, acid-base physiology, metabolic rate, and survival of adult Antarctic krill. Ingestion and clearance rates of chlorophyll were depressed under low pH (7.7) compared to ambient pH (8.1) after a 48 h acclimation period, but this difference disappeared after a 21 d acclimation. Growth rates were negligible and frequently negative, but were significantly more negative at high (3 degrees C, -0.03 mm d(-1)) compared to ambient temperature (0 degrees C, -0.01 mm d(-1)) with no effect of pH. Modest elevations in tissue total CO2 and tissue pH were apparent at low pH but were short-lived. Metabolic rate increased with temperature but was suppressed at low pH in smaller but not larger krill. Although effects of elevated temperature and/or decreased pH were mostly sublethal, mortality was higher at high temperature/low pH (58\%) compared to ambient temperature/pH or ambient temperature/low pH (> 90\%). This study identified 3 dominant patterns: (1) shorter-term effects were primarily pH-dependent; (2) krill compensated for lower pH relatively quickly; and (3) longer-term effects on krill growth and survival were strongly driven by temperature with little to no pH effect.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Saba, GK (Corresponding Author), Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Ocean Observing Leadership, Dept Marine \& Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.

Due to its central position in the food web, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species of the marine Antarctic ecosystem. It is therefore crucial to understand how increasing water temperatures affect important krill life-cycle processes. Here, a long-term (August - March) laboratory acclimation experiment at different temperature scenarios (0.5 degrees C, 1.5 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, 3.5 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 7 degrees C) was performed and the effects of elevated temperatures on whole animal parameters (O2 consumption, body length, length of the digestive gland) were analyzed. The response of krill oxygen consumption to different experimental temperatures differed between acute/short-term and long-term acclimation. After 8 months, krill oxygen consumption remained unchanged up to temperatures of 3.5 degrees C and was significantly higher at temperatures > 3.5 degrees C. Krill acclimated to temperatures > 3.5 degrees C were significantly smaller at the end of the experiment. Limited food intake and/or conversion may have contributed to this effect, especially pronounced after the onset of the reproductive period. In addition, the seasonal growth pattern in males differed from that of females. Together, our findings indicate that warming Southern Ocean waters are likely to increase metabolic rate in krill, possibly altering the amount of energy available for other important life-cycle processes, a finding directly related to future population dynamics and fisheries management.","ELSEVIER GMBH","HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY","English","Michael, K (Corresponding Author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem \& Biol Marine Environm, Carl von Ossietzky Str 9-11, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.

Laboratory tests reveal that krill are sensitive to ocean acidification despite residing in naturally low pH areas, showing the importance of modulating factors for determining their responses. This study combines laboratory manipulations with field observations across a strong natural water chemistry gradient in Puget Sound, Washington, USA to investigate the effects of pH and oxygen on adult female North Pacific krill, Euphausia pacifica. Enzyme activities of the Electron Transport System (ETS) and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS) were used as indices of zooplankton metabolism and growth, respectively, and were paired with traditional incubation methods. Acclimation to pH and oxygen conditions in the laboratory did not reveal effects on respiration rate, ETS, or AARS activity of krill. However, field observations showed that respiratory potential, as estimated by ETS activity, decreased with decreasing oxygen, declining 9\% (95\% confidence interval 2.5-15\%) over the range of conditions we observed (3.9-8.1 mg O-2 L-1). This reduction would depress the metabolic potential of krill in areas of stressful conditions (concurrent low pH), though krill also displayed a high degree of inter-individual variability. Although differences in age structure suggest different patterns of recruitment between E. pacifica populations in areas with stressful conditions and those without, populations persist at stressful sites. Lower temperature of waters with low oxygen and pH, as well as high food concentrations, may contribute to these populations' success.","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","English","McLaskey, AK (Corresponding Author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans \& Fisheries, 2202 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.

During the breeding season, foraging trips by lactating female fur seals are constrained by their need to return to land to provision their pups. Post-breeding, seals disperse in order to feed and recover condition; estimates indicate c.70\% of females remain near to South Georgia, whilst others head west towards the Patagonian Shelf or south to the ice-edge. The krill fishery at South Georgia operates only during the winter, providing the potential for fur seal: fishery interaction during these months. Here we use available winter (May to September) tracking data from Platform Terminal Transmitter (PTT) tags deployed on female fur seals at Bird Island, South Georgia. We develop habitat models describing their distribution during the winters of 1999 and 2003 with the aim of visualising and quantifying the degree of spatial overlap between female fur seals and krill harvesting in South Georgia waters. We show that spatial distribution of fur seals around South Georgia is extensive, and that the krill fishery overlaps with small, highly localised areas of available fur seal habitat. From these findings we discuss the implications for management, and future work.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Bamford, CCG (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England.

Using historical whaling data from 1926-1954, in combination with temperature data for the Southern Ocean, a gamma GLM with temporal dependency was fitted to 20,144 records of B. m. intermedia foetus size using Bayesian inference. There was a negative relationship between antecedent winter sea surface temperature (SST) in the Southern Ocean on foetus size. This relationship is proposed as being mediated by a positive effect of the extent of winter sea ice on Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) abundance on which B. m. intermedia feed. There was also a positive density-dependent effect of a ``krill surplus{''} at low B. m. intermedia population sizes. However, the positive effect of a ``krill surplus{''} at low B. m. intermedia population size on foetus growth was reversed at elevated winter SST due to a proposed negative impact on E. superba recruitment. Projected increases in temperature in the Southern Ocean are predicted to compromise the growth rates of B. m. intermedia foetuses, with implications for the capacity of the subspecies to recover from overexploitation.","INST VERTEBRATE BIOLOGY AS CR","KVETNA 8, BRNO 603 65, CZECH REPUBLIC","English","Smith, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Lodz, Dept Ecol \& Vertebrate Zool, Lodz, Poland.

We explore in detail three key services (the `blue carbon' pathway, the Antarctic krill fishery, and Antarctic tourism), tracing the consequences of climate change from physical drivers through biological impacts to the benefits to humans. We consider potential non-climatic drivers of change, current and future demands for the services, and the main global and regional policy frameworks that could be used to manage risks to the provision of these services in a changing climate.

Ten key messages emerged that have stakeholder-relevance and/or a high impact for the scientific community. They address (i) altered biogeochemical cycles, (ii) ocean acidification, (iii) climate change hotspots, (iv) unexpected dynamism in seabed-dwelling populations, (v) spatial range shifts, (vi) adaptation and thermal resilience, (vii) sea ice related biological fluctuations, (viii) pollution, (ix) endangered terrestrial endemism and (x) the discovery of unknown habitats. Most Antarctic biotas are exposed to multiple stresses and considered vulnerable to environmental change due to narrow tolerance ranges, rapid change, projected circumpolar impacts, low potential for timely genetic adaptation, and migration barriers. Important ecosystem functions, such as primary production and energy transfer between trophic levels, have already changed, and biodiversity patterns have shifted. A confidence assessment of the degree of `scientific understanding' revealed an intermediate level for most of the more detailed sub-messages, indicating that process-oriented research has been successful in the past decade. Additional efforts are necessary, however, to achieve the level of robustness in scientific knowledge that is required to inform protection measures of the unique Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and their contributions to global biodiversity and ecosystem services.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Gutt, J (Corresponding Author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar \& Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Columbusstr, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany.

The coast of the Antarctic continent is the only habitat of the iconic Adelie penguin, whose main diet is Antarctic krill. Current threats to Adelie Penguins, other Antarctic krill predators and Antarctic krill itself include sea-ice loss as a result of climate change and krill fishing. We use a spatially and temporally dynamic food web model of the region surrounding the Western Antarctic Peninsula to evaluate the potential impacts of various marine protected area scenarios in the context of climate change. We examine the effects of sustained sea-ice loss on krill and seven monitored krill predators. We evaluate four marine protected area scenarios given two scenarios that describe future changes in sea ice and three scenarios that describe future changes in krill fishing effort. Our results indicate that establishing no-take zones where krill might aggregate in the future and where some krill predators forage could positively affect biomass accumulation of krill and the predators. No-take zones may be particularly important for enhancing the resilience of species that have recently experienced population decline and ensuring positive outcomes from establishing a marine protected area in the region. Our simulations suggest that establishing protected areas in the right locations can play an important role in mitigating the negative effects of climate change on iconic species that many people want to conserve.","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","English","de Mutsert, K (Corresponding Author), George Mason Univ, Dept Environm Sci \& Policy, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.

Our analysis reveals that coastal size distributions of this linchpin species are related to temperature and chlorophyll a concentration, and indicate that warm climate events disrupt and suppress typical seasonal dynamics, resulting in persistent shifts towards populations dominated by smaller juveniles and adults. The 2014-16 marine heatwave (MHW) resulted in sharp and sustained transition in the size structure of E. pacifica off northern California; we captured numerous mature individuals smaller than any previously reported in the literature and larger size classes were conspicuously absent or rare when the MHW most strongly impacted coastal waters. Early life history stages exhibited a contrasting response, shifting instead towards larger size distributions during warm years. Advection appears to be the dominant mechanism driving rapid shifts in E. pacifica size structure off northern California, which implies alongshore and cross-shelf gradients in life history expression (e.g., changes in size-at-maturation) related primarily to temperature. Variability in food availability (chlorophyll concentration) and physiological responses (e.g., changes in growth rates) likely contribute to seasonal variability, but appear insufficient to account for sharp, climate-driven transitions. Climate-driven shifts in individual and total biomass of this critical and dominant forage species have important ecological implications, particularly for growth and survival of species at higher trophic levels. Given that warm water events are likely to increase with climate change, the effects of the 2014-16 MHW on E. pacifica in coastal waters may serve as a harbinger for future change. Detailed information on size structure of euphausiid populations is fundamental to understanding population responses to and ecosystem consequences of climatic and environmental forcing, and has been incorporated in assessments that support ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management.","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","English","Robertson, RR (Corresponding Author), Humboldt State Univ, Cooperat Inst Marine Ecosyst \& Climate, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.

Profiling the benefits and costs associated with marine protected areas and displaced fishing in the Scotia Sea","PLOS ONE","2020","15","12-Aug","Both costs and benefits must be considered when implementing marine protected areas (MPAs), particularly those associated with fishing effort displaced by potential closures. The Southern Ocean offers a case study in understanding such tradeoffs, where MPAs are actively being discussed to achieve a range of protection and sustainable use objectives. Here, we evaluated the possible impacts of two MPA scenarios on the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery and krill-dependent predators in the Scotia Sea, explicitly addressing the displacement of fishing from closed areas. For both scenarios, we employed a minimally realistic, spatially explicit ecosystem model and considered three alternative redistributions of displaced fishing. We projected both MPAs to provide positive outcomes for many krill-dependent predators, especially when closed areas included at least 50-75\% of their foraging distributions. Further, differences between the scenarios suggest ways to improve seal and penguin protection in the Scotia Sea. MPA scenarios also projected increases in total fishery yields, but alongside risks of fishing in areas where relatively low krill densities could cause the fishery to suspend operations. The three alternatives for redistributing displaced fishing had little effect on benefits to predators, but did matter for the fishery, with greater differences in overall catch and risk of fishing in areas of low krill density when displaced fishing was redistributed evenly among the open areas. Collectively, results suggest a well-designed MPA in the Scotia Sea may protect krill-dependent predators, even with displaced fishing, and preclude further spatial management of the krill fishery outside the MPA. More broadly, outcomes denote the importance of delineating fishing and predator habitat, spatial scales, and the critical trade-offs inherent in MPA development.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Klein, ES (Corresponding Author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, La Jolla, CA 92038 USA.

Few winter studies exist from which to infer impacts of changing environmental conditions on the biology of krill. Here demographic and maturity patterns of krill during five winters are examined at an overwintering hotspot in the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Two different recruitment pulses were present over the 5 years of the study. A large recruitment event was evident in winter 2012, followed by cohort growth tracked through winter 2014. A recruitment event also occurred in 2015, despite lower abundance of larvae in 2013 and 2014. The recruitment pulse in 2015 was correlated with the intrusion of high salinity water, characteristic of the Weddell Sea, during a positive El Nino-Southern Oscillation phase, suggesting recruitment was driven by advection of recruits into the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Despite the inter-annual environmental variability, most female krill were in resting reproductive stages in all years. The lack of variability in female reproductive status during winter may impose a developmental constraint to earlier spawning than previously considered; the time necessary to advance from resting stages to reproductive maturity may limit the ability of krill to adapt to trends in the timing and magnitude of the spring bloom. The observed patterns of recruitment and variation in maturity stages highlight the complexity of krill population dynamics and should be considered when projecting population responses of Antarctic krill to climate-driven changes in the Southern Ocean.","SPRINGER","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","English","Reiss, CS (Corresponding Author), NOAA Fisheries, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.

This study investigates environmental factors determining abundance and distribution of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and their prey (Euphausia pacificaandThysanoessa spinifera) in central California. We provide insights into environmental drivers of the ecology and distribution of these species, model whale distributions and determine coincident hotspots of whales and their prey that will help decrease human threats to whales and protect critical feeding habitat. We developed separate predictive models of whale abundances (using negative binomial regression on count data) and krill abundance (using a two-part hurdlemodel combining logistic and negative binomial regressions) over a 14 year period (2004-2017). Variables includedin situsurface and midwater oceanographic measures (temperature, salinity, and fluorescence), basin-scale climate indices, and bathymetric- and distance-related data. Predictions were applied to 1 km(2)cells spanning the study area for May, June, July, and September during each of the 14 years of surveys to identify persistent distribution patterns. Both whales and krill were found to consistently use the northeast region of Cordell Bank, the Farallon Escarpment, and the shelf-break waters. The main identified blue whale hotspots were also krill hotspots, while co-occurrence was more limited and varied seasonally for humpback whales and krill. These results are valuable in identifying patterns in important areas of ecological interaction to assist management of whales. Areas north of Cordell Bank are of particular management concern since they overlap with the end of the San Francisco Bay northern shipping lane. Our findings can help decrease threats to whales, particularly in important foraging areas, by supporting implementation of vessel management and informing potential conflicts with other human uses.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Rockwood, RC (Corresponding Author), Point Blue Conservat Sci, Petaluma, CA 94954 USA.

While salp abundance is hypothesized to increase, krill abundance is hypothesized to decline with dramatic consequences for the entire food web of the Southern Ocean. A better understanding of the biotic interaction between krill and salps and their population dynamics is thus crucial. However, the life cycle of salps is complicated and barely understood. Therefore, we have developed an individual-based model describing the whole life cycle to better understand the population dynamics of salps and the conditions for blooms. The model has been used to explore if and under what conditions the empirical pattern of large variability in observed salp abundances at the WAP, generated by the long-term data of the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program (AMLR) can emerge from a small seeding population. The model reproduced this empirical pattern if daily growth rates of oozoids were higher than previously reported for the WAP (mean growth rate for oozoids similar to 1 mm d(-1)) and if growth rates of blastozooids were lower (mean growth rate similar to 0.2 mm d(-1)). The model suggests that a prerequisite for local salp blooms requires a small founding population in early spring. With climate change it has been suggested that more frequent and earlier transport of salps into the WAP or winter survival will occur. Hence, the risk of salp blooms in the WAP is likely to substantially increase. These findings highlight the importance for an improved quantitative understanding of how primary production and the southward advection of salps will be impacted by climate change.","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","English","Groeneveld, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Leipzig, Dept Econ, Deutsch Pl 5e, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.

Combining a krill growth model with projected climate scenarios shows the growth habitat is likely to experience only moderate change, with the northern edges most at risk. Antarctic krill is a key species of important Southern Ocean food webs, yet how changes in ocean temperature and primary production may impact their habitat quality remains poorly understood. We provide a circumpolar assessment of the robustness of krill growth habitat to climate change by coupling an empirical krill growth model with projections from a weighted subset of IPCC Earth system models. We find that 85\% of the study area experienced only a moderate change in relative gross growth potential (+/- 20\%) by 2100. However, a temporal shift in seasonal timings of habitat quality may cause disjunctions between krill's biological timings and the future environment. Regions likely to experience habitat quality decline or retreat are concentrated near the northern limits of krill distribution and in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen seas region during autumn, meaning habitat will likely shift to higher latitudes in these areas.","NATURE PORTFOLIO","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","English","Veytia, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine \& Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.

These services are underpinned by different energetic pathways including those dominated by Antarctic krill, fishes and squids, or gelatinous zooplankton (salps). Climate change is likely to impact Southern Ocean food webs by affecting their foundations - both primary producer communities and ice habitats. However, the implications of these changes for ecosystem services - including wildlife populations, fisheries and carbon sequestration - are unclear, as are the implications for policy and management. Here, we use a generalised representation of Southern Ocean food webs and qualitative network modelling to investigate the consequences of five simple but plausible scenarios of future change for ecosystem services and the conservation of important taxa: (i) a shift in primary producer communities with decreasing large diatoms and increasing small flagellates; (ii) increasing salps; (iii) increase (recovery) of the Great whales; and unregulated and unsustainable fisheries for (iv) krill or (v) toothfish. Strikingly, our results suggest that increases in salps might not have negative consequences for ecosystem services and could enhance carbon export potential. Simulated increases in unregulated krill and toothfish fisheries affect predatory wildlife and could also reduce carbon export potential. Our results emphasise the important policy implications of understanding the structure and change of whole food webs, and highlight that improved quantitative understanding and modelling of the relative importance of different energy pathways will be important for developing robust management responses to climate change impacts.","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","English","Trebilco, R (Corresponding Author), CSIRO Oceans \& Atmosphere, Battery Point, Tas 7004, Australia.

This specialization has inextricably linked habitat use, life history and evolution of this pinniped species to the distribution of its prey. Therefore, the foraging habitat of crabeater seals can be used to infer the distribution of Antarctic krill. Here, we combined seal movements and diving behaviour with environmental variables to build a foraging habitat model for crabeater seals for the rapidly changing western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Our projections show that future crabeater seal foraging habitat and, by inference, krill distribution will expand towards offshore waters and the southern WAP in response to changes in circulation, water temperature and sea ice distribution. Antarctic krill biomass is projected to be negatively affected by the environmental changes, which are anticipated to manifest as a decrease in krill densities in coastal waters, with impacts on the land-/ice-based krill predator community, particularly in the northern WAP. Crabeater seals feed predominantly on Antarctic krill. Combining seal tracks and diving behaviour with environmental variables allows the future foraging habitat, and therefore krill distribution, to be predicted, suggesting a shift offshore and south along the western Antarctic Peninsula.","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","English","Huckstadt, LA (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol \& Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.

We examined within and between year variation of trends in both the environment and krill biochemistry data. Chlorophyll a levels were positively related to krill lipid levels, particularly triacylglycerol. Plankton fatty acid biomarkers analysed in krill (such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) increased with decreasing sea surface temperature and increasing chlorophyll a levels.

Due to their circumpolar distribution and the remoteness and vastness of their habitat, little is known about their population sizes. Estimating pack-ice seal population sizes and trends is key to understanding how the Southern Ocean ecosystem will react to threats such as climate change driven sea ice loss and krill fishing. We present a functional pack-ice seal detection pipeline using Worldview-3 imagery and a Convolutional Neural Network that counts and locates seal centroids. We propose a new CNN architecture that detects objects by combining semantic segmentation heatmaps with binary classification and counting by regression. Our pipeline locates over 30\% of seals, when compared to consensus counts from human experts, and reduces the time required for seal detection by 95\% (assuming just a single GPU). While larger training sets and continued algorithm development will no doubt improve classification accuracy, our pipeline, which can be easily adapted for other large-bodied animals visible in sub-meter satellite imagery, demonstrates the potential for machine learning to vastly expand our capacity for regular pack-ice seal surveys and, in doing so, will contribute to ongoing international efforts to monitor pack-ice seals.","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","English","Goncalves, BC (Corresponding Author), Dept Ecol \& Evolut, 610 Life Sci Bldg, Stony Brook, NY 11777 USA.

Difficulties measuring the impacts of fisheries removals on dependent predators maintain this perspective, but consideration of the spatio-temporal scales over which forage species, their predators, and fisheries interact can aid assessment of whether low catch limits are as precautionary as presumed. Antarctic krill are targeted by the largest fishery in the Southern Ocean and are key forage for numerous predators. Current krill removals are considered precautionary and have not been previously observed to affect krill-dependent predators, like penguins. Using a hierarchical model and 30+ years of monitoring data, we show that expected penguin performance was reduced when local harvest rates of krill were >= 0.1, and this effect was similar in magnitude to that of poor environmental conditions. With continued climate warming and high local harvest rates, future observations of penguin performance are predicted to be below the long-term mean with a probability of 0.77. Catch limits that are considered precautionary for forage species simply because the limit is a small proportion of the species' standing biomass may not be precautionary for their predators.","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","English",NA,"10.1038/s41598-020-59223-9","2314",NA,NA,"KRILL EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA; SOUTH-SHETLAND ISLANDS; PYGOSCELID PENGUINS; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VARIABILITY; RECRUITMENT; RESPONSES; OPTIONS; BIOMASS","Science \& Technology - Other Topics","Multidisciplinary Sciences","George.Watters@noaa.gov",NA,"U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); Borrego Springs, California","This research was conducted as part of the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Exceptions are trypsin and other digestive proteases from a few cold-adapted or temperate fish and crustacean species. These enzymes are more efficient than enzymes from microorganism and higher vertebrates that have been used traditionally. However, the biomedical potential of digestive proteases from warm environment species has received less research attention. This review aims to provide an overview of this unrealised biomedical potential, using the debridement application as a paradigm. Debridement is intended to remove nonviable, necrotic and contaminated tissue, as well as fibrin clots, and is a key step in wound treatment. We discuss the physiological role of enzymes in wound healing, the use of exogenous enzymes in debridement, and the limitations of cold-adapted enzymes such as their poor thermal stability. We show that digestive proteases from tropical crustaceans may have advantages over their cold-adapted counterparts for this and similar uses. Differences in thermal stability, auto-proteolytic stability, and susceptibility to proteinase inhibitors are discussed. Furthermore, it is proposed that the feeding behaviour of the source organism may direct the evaluation of enzymes for particular applications, as digestive proteases have evolved to fill a wide variety of feeding habitats, natural substrates, and environmental conditions. We encourage more research on the biomedical application of digestive enzymes from tropical marine crustaceans.","UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA","SCH BIOL SCI, PULAU PINANG, 00000, MALAYSIA","English","Perera, E (Corresponding Author), CSIC, IATS, Nutrigen \& Fish Growth Endocrinol, Valencia, Spain.

These islands experience a range of conditions in terms of physical and biological habitat, creating a natural laboratory to investigate local genetic adaptation. One striking habitat difference is in the availability of Euphausia superba krill as prey, which has led to A. gazella exhibiting a range of diets. A. gazella in some colonies consume exclusively krill, while their conspecifics in other colonies feed mainly on fish and consume few to no krill. To investigate potential adaptations to these different prey fields, reduced representation genome sequencing was conducted on A. gazella from the 8 major colonies. Twenty-seven genomic regions exhibiting signatures of natural selection were identified. Two of these genomic regions were clearly associated with seals living in krill-dominated areas or those in fish-dominated areas. Twenty-two additional genomic regions under selection showed a pattern consistent with prey differences as the driver of selection after historical migrations from krill-dominated habitats where lineages evolved to present krill-poor habitat areas were taken into account. Only 1 of the genomic regions identified appeared to be explained by any other environmental variable analysed (depth). Genomic regions under prey-driven selection included genes associated with regulation of gene expression, skeletal development, and lipid metabolism. Adaptation to local prey has implications for spatial management of this species and for the potential impacts of climate- or harvest-driven reductions in krill abundance on these seals.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Cleary, AC (Corresponding Author), Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.

At South Georgia, Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella are known cephalopod predators and potential indicators of changes in regional environment conditions and prey availability. The cephalopod component of the diet of Antarctic fur seals at South Georgia was assessed using lower beaks found in scats collected over 5 consecutive years (2009-2013) under known variable oceanographic conditions. In years of unusually warm oceanographic conditions around South Georgia and low Antarctic krill Euphausia superba density, the number of squids Slosarczykovia circumantarctica increased in the seals' diet. Moreover, stable isotope analysis of beaks showed that S. circumantarctica exhibited higher delta N-15 values in years that were associated with an offshore habitat (lower delta C-13 values) where Antarctic fur seals had been foraging. This study provides evidence of the ecological links between the feeding behaviour of Antarctic fur seals, their main cephalopod prey, Antarctic krill densities and oceanographic conditions.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Abreu, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Coimbra, Marine \& Environm Sci Ctr MARE UC, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal.

Here, a Bayesian population model integrates catch data, estimates of abundance, and information on genetics and biology to assess the recovery of western South Atlantic (WSA) humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Modelling scenarios evaluated the sensitivity of model outputs resulting from the use of different data, different model assumptions and uncertainty in catch allocation and in accounting for whales killed but not landed. A long period of exploitation drove WSA humpback whales to the brink of extinction. They declined from nearly 27 000 (95\% PI = 22 800-33 000) individuals in 1830 to only 450 (95\% PI = 200-1400) whales in the mid-1950s. Protection led to a strong recovery and the current population is estimated to be at 93\% (95\% PI = 73-100\%) of its pre-exploitation size. The recovery of WSA humpback whales may result in large removals of their primary prey, the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and has the potential to modify the community structure in their feeding grounds. Continued monitoring is needed to understand how these whales will respond to modern threats and to climate-driven changes to their habitats.","ROYAL SOC","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","English","Zerbini, AN (Corresponding Author), NOAA, Marine Mammal Lab, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.

Similarly, within species individuals may specialize on specific dietary resources or foraging habitats. Such individual specialization seems to occur particularly in environments with predictable resource distribution and limited environmental variability. Still, little is known about how seasonal environmental variability affects segregation of resources within species and between closely related sympatric species. The aim of the study was to investigate the foraging behaviour of three closely related and sympatrically breeding fulmarine petrels (Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica, cape petrels Daption capense and southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides) in a seasonally highly variable environment (Prydz Bay, Antarctica) with the aim of assessing inter- and intraspecific overlap in utilized habitat, timing of foraging and diet and to identify foraging habitat preferences. We used GPS loggers with wet/dry sensors to assess spatial habitat utilization over the entire breeding season. Trophic overlap was investigated using stable isotope analysis based on blood, feathers and egg membranes. Foraging locations were identified using wet/dry data recorded by the GPS loggers and expectation-maximization binary clustering. Foraging habitat preferences were modelled using generalized additive models and model cross-validation. During incubation and chick-rearing, the utilization distribution of all three species overlapped significantly and species also overlapped in the timing of foraging during the day-partly during incubation and completely during chick-rearing. Isotopic centroids showed no significant segregation between at least two species for feathers and egg membranes, and among all species during incubation (reflected by blood). Within species, there was no individual specialization in foraging sites or environmental space. Furthermore, no single environmental covariate predicted foraging activity along trip trajectories. Instead, best-explanatory environmental covariates varied within and between individuals even across short temporal scales, reflecting a highly generalist behaviour of birds. Our results may be explained by optimal foraging theory. In the highly productive but spatio-temporally variable Antarctic environment, being a generalist may be key to finding mobile prey-even though this increases the potential for competition within and among sympatric species.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Dehnhard, N (Corresponding Author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Behav Ecol \& Ecophysiol Grp, Antwerp, Belgium.

Blue whales Balaenoptera musculus rely mostly on stored energy reserves for reproduction. They feed almost exclusively on krill, which vary in density and abundance both spatially and temporally. We used 10 depth-velocity archival tags deployed on blue whales foraging in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada, to identify feeding events. We modeled krill densities required to equal or exceed energy expenditures and allow energy storage. During the daytime, blue whales generally dove deeper and performed fewer but longer feeding dives than at other times of the diel cycle (10 vs. 28 feeding dives h(-1)); however, they performed more lunges per dive during daytime (3 vs. 1 lunge dive(-1)), which resulted in a stable feeding rate around the clock. Only 11.7 and 5.5 \% of the Arctic and northern krill patches measured in situ contained densities allowing blue whales to achieve neutral energetic balance (FE = 1); less than 1.5 \% of patches allowed FE of >= 3. While FE leading to successful reproduction and adequate fitness is unknown, these results underscore the necessity for blue whales to seek the highest densities within patches to reach neutral balance or allow energy storage. These findings further our understanding of blue whale foraging ecology and habitat suitability, and may help predict the effects of climate and natural variability or of potential fisheries on krill densities and blue whale condition.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Guilpin, M (Corresponding Author), Fisheries \& Oceans Canada, Maurice Lamontagne Inst, 850 Route Mer, Mont Jolt, PQ G5H 3Z4, Canada.

Understanding how different behaviors (e.g. foraging) are shaped by dynamic environmental features is fundamental to understanding ecological interactions and the impact of variability. In this study we deployed satellite-linked tags on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and used state-space models to estimate locations and to infer underlying behavioral states. We then modelled the association between whale behavior (e.g. foraging or transiting) and environmental variables using linear mixed-effect models, We identified the importance of two recently discovered Southern Ocean feeding areas for Oceania humpback whales as well as the key environmental drivers affecting whale behavior. We detected behavioral differences between whales utilizing the two adjacent feeding regions (similar to 2000 km apart), which were likely caused by animals trying to efficiently locate prey in relation to the dynamic environmental characteristics of each habitat. We observed a seasonal pattern in foraging behavior, with the peak occurring in the middle of summer. Whales also foraged more intensively with increasing proximity to areas from which the ice edge had recently retreated, suggesting heightened productivity in these areas. The relationship between the animals and the physical features of the seascape, as well as the behavioral plasticity observed, could have implications for the future recovery of these whales in a changing Southern Ocean.","ELSEVIER","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","Riekkola, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand.

We tested the hypothesis that recent declines in the recruitment of a number of spiny lobster populations in different parts of the world are the result of increasing coastal water temperatures that deplete the metabolic reserves of recently settled post-larvae. We examined the resilience of recently settled juvenile lobsters to the depletion of their reserves in 2 species of spiny lobster from temperate waters. Juveniles of Jasus edwardsii survived on average (+/- SE) for 34.44 +/- 3.44 d without feeding at 19-21 degrees C, while Sagmariasus verreauxi survived for 39.96 +/- 1.40 d, with no differences in survival among 3 temperature regimes (17, 20 and 23 degrees C). The point of no return for recently-settled juveniles of S. verreauxi was estimated to be 30.40 +/- 13.50 d, which was close to their average survival under starvation conditions. Starved juvenile lobsters close to the point of no return with extremely low remaining protein and lipid (6.52\% lipid and 27.18\% protein of dry body mass) were capable of surviving once food was supplied. These results indicate that newly settled juveniles of spiny lobsters from temperate waters can endure adverse nutritional conditions over a wide range of thermal conditions for prolonged periods, making them resilient to future increases in water temperatures as a result of climate change.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Garcia-Echauri, LL (Corresponding Author), Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Leigh Marine Lab, 160 Goat Isl Rd, Leigh 0985, New Zealand.

Within this sector, our first goal was to produce quantitative distribution maps of all six ontogenetic life stages of krill (eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii, calyptopes, furcilia, juveniles, and adults), based on a compilation of all available post 1970s data. Using these maps, we then examined firstly whether ``hotspots{''} of egg production and early stage nursery occurred, and secondly whether the available habitat was partitioned between the successive life stages during the austral summer and autumn, when krill densities can be high. To address these questions, we compiled larval krill density records and extracted data spanning 41 years (1976-2016) from the existing KRILLBASE-abundance and KRILLBASE-length-frequency databases. Although adult males and females of spawning age were widely distributed, the distribution of eggs, nauplii and metanauplii indicates that spawning is most intense over the shelf and shelf slope. This contrasts with the distributions of calyptope and furcilia larvae, which were concentrated further offshore, mainly in the Southern Scotia Sea. Juveniles, however, were strongly concentrated over shelves along the Scotia Arc. Simple environmental analyses based on water depth and mean water temperature suggest that krill associate with different habitats over the course of their life cycle. From the early to late part of the austral season, juvenile distribution moves from ocean to shelf, opposite in direction to that for adults. Such habitat partitioning may reduce intraspecific competition for food, which has been suggested to occur when densities are exceptionally high during years of strong recruitment. It also prevents any potential cannibalism by adults on younger stages. Understanding the location of krill spawning and juvenile development in relation to potentially overlapping fishing activities is needed to protect the health of the south-west Atlantic sector ecosystem.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Atkinson, A (Corresponding Author), Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth, Devon, England.

Although most Southern Hemisphere populations are slowly recovering, the influence of future climate change on their recovery remains unknown. We investigate the impacts of two anthropogenic pressures-historical commercial whaling and future climate change-on populations of baleen whales (blue, fin, humpback, Antarctic minke, southern right) and their prey (krill and copepods) in the Southern Ocean. We use a climate-biological coupled ``Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments{''} (MICE) that links krill and whale population dynamics with climate change drivers, including changes in ocean temperature, primary productivity and sea ice. Models predict negative future impacts of climate change on krill and all whale species, although the magnitude of impacts on whales differs among populations. Despite initial recovery from historical whaling, models predict concerning declines under climate change, even local extinctions by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue, fin and southern right whales, and Atlantic/Indian fin and humpback whales. Predicted declines were a consequence of reduced prey (copepods/krill) from warming and increasing interspecific competition between whale species. We model whale population recovery under an alternative scenario whereby whales adapt their migratory patterns to accommodate changing sea ice in the Antarctic and a shifting prey base. Plasticity in range size and migration was predicted to improve recovery for ice-associated blue and minke whales. Our study highlights the need for ongoing protection to help depleted whale populations recover, as well as local management to ensure the krill prey base remains viable, but this may have limited success without immediate action to reduce emissions.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Tulloch, VJD (Corresponding Author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Sch Environm \& Sci, Nathan, Qld, Australia.

There was clear geographic differentiation in mercury concentrations, with specimens from the South Orkney Islands having total mercury concentrations 5 to 7 times higher than Antarctic krill from South Georgia and the Antarctic Polar Front. Mercury did not appear to accumulate with life-stage since juveniles had higher concentrations of total mercury (0.071 mu g g(-1) from South Orkney Islands; 0.014 mu g g(-1) from South Georgia) than adults (0.054 mu g g(-1) in females and 0.048 mu g g(-1) in males from South Orkney Islands; 0.006 mu g g(-1) in females and 0.007 mu g g(-1) in males from South Georgia). Results suggest that females may use egg laying as a mechanism to excrete mercury, with eggs having higher concentrations than the corresponding somatic tissue. Organic mercury makes up a minor percentage of total mercury (15-37\%) with the percentage being greater in adults than in juveniles. When compared to euphausiids from other parts of the world, the concentration of mercury in Antarctic krill is within the same range, or higher, highlighting the global distribution of this contaminant. Given the high potential for biomagnification of mercury through food webs, concentrations in Antarctic krill may have deleterious effects on long-lived Antarctic krill predators.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a super-abundant species with a circumpolar distribution, and the krill microbiome may make a substantial contribution to marine bacterial diversity in the Southern Ocean. We used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to characterize bacterial diversity in seawater and krill tissue samples from four locations south of the Kerguelen Plateau, one of the most productive regions in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean. Krill-associated bacterial communities were distinct from those of the surrounding seawater, with different communities inhabiting the moults, digestive tract and faecal pellets, including several phyla not detected in the surrounding seawater. Digestive tissues from many individuals contained a potential gut symbiont (order: Mycoplasmoidales) shown to improve survival on a low quality diet in other crustaceans. Antarctic krill swarms thus influence Southern Ocean microbial communities not only through top-down grazing of eukaryotic cells and release of nutrients into the water column, but also by transporting distinct microbial assemblages horizontally via migration and vertically via sinking faecal pellets and moulted exuviae. Changes to Antarctic krill demographics or distribution through fishing pressure or climate-induced range shifts will also influence the composition and dispersal of Southern Ocean microbial communities.","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","English","Clarke, LJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Tasmania, Antarctic Climate \& Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia.

We present here a simplified DEB model for the swimming crab Liocarcinus depurator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to be presented for this species. Most applications of the standard DEB model assume continuous growth in all size metrics (length, wet mass, carbon content) of the modelled species. However, in crustaceans growth, measured as an increase of carapace length/width, occurs periodically via moult. To account for this, we have extended the model to track the continuous increase in carbon mass as well as the episodic increase in physical size. Model predictions were consistent with the patterns in the observed data, predicting both the moult increment and the intermoult period of an individual. In addition to presenting the model itself, we also make recommendations for further development, and evaluate the potential applications of such a model, both at the individual level (e.g. aquaculture) and as a potential tool for population level dynamics (e.g. fisheries stock assessment).","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","English","Talbot, SE (Corresponding Author), Plymouth Marine Lab, Prospect Pl, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.

Overwintering studies have focused on larval and adult krill, but we know little about how juvenile krill overwinter. The late winter diet of juvenile krill is important because it will determine their growth and development rates and consequently their reproductive potential the following spring. A diet rich in ice algae would promote growth and reproductive development. The Bransfield Strait (northern Antarctic Peninsula, AP) is an important overwintering ground for krill; it has been proposed this region offers a food-rich winter environment. We examined the contribution of ice algae to the energy budget of overwintering juvenile krill during 2 years with contrasting sea ice conditions. Grazing on ice algae contributed approximate to 146\% to their winter energy budget in 2015, even though ice concentrations were 50\% and consisted of newly formed pancake ice. However, when sea ice advanced late in the Bransfield Strait (2016), ice algae contributed significantly less (approximate to 16\%) to the winter energy budget of juvenile krill. Delayed sea ice advance may negatively affect growth and reproductive development of overwintering juvenile krill.","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","English","Bernard, KS (Corresponding Author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean \& Atmospher Sci, 104 CEOAS Admin Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA.

Baleen whale foraging habitat has largely been described at a population level, yet population responses to change are the result of individual strategies across multiple scales. This study aimed to determine how the foraging behaviour of individual whales varied relative to environmental conditions along their movement path. Biotelemetry devices provided information on humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) movement at two spatial scales in East Antarctica, and a mixed modelling approach was used at a medium scale (tens of kilometres) to determine which environmental factors correlated with a change in foraging behaviour. Water temperature was linked to a change in foraging behaviour at both spatial scales. At the medium scale, warmer water was associated with the resident state, commonly assumed to represent periods of foraging behaviour. However, fine-scale analyses suggested that cooler water was associated with a higher feeding rate. Variation in whale foraging behaviour with changes in water temperature adds support to the hypothesis that whales may be able to track environmental conditions to find prey. Future research should investigate this pattern further, given the predicted rise in water temperatures under climate-change scenarios.","CSIRO PUBLISHING","UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA","English","Owen, K (Corresponding Author), Alaska SeaLife Ctr, Seward, AK 99664 USA.

Location Methods South Orkney Islands, Antarctica. Penguins from four colonies across the South Orkney Islands were tracked using global positioning systems (GPSs) and time depth recorders (TDRs). Relationships between a variety of environmental and geometric variables and the at-sea distribution of penguins were investigated using general additive models for the three main phases of the breeding season. Subsequently, the final models were extrapolated across the South Orkney archipelago to predict the at-sea distribution of penguins from colonies where no tracking data are available. Finally, the overlap between areas used by chinstrap penguins and the krill fishery was quantified. Results Main conclusions The foraging distribution of chinstrap penguins can be predicted using two simple and static variables: the distance from the colony and the direction of travel towards the shelf-edge, while avoiding high densities of Pygoscelis penguins from other colonies. Additionally, we find that the chinstrap penguins breeding on the South Orkney Islands use areas which overlap with frequently used krill fishing areas and that this overlap is most prominent during the brood and creche phases of the breeding season. This is the first step in understanding the potential impacts of the krill fishery, for all colonies including those where no empirical tracking data are available. However, with the available data, it is not currently possible to infer an impact of the krill fisheries on penguins. With this in mind, we recommend the implementation of monitoring schemes to investigate the effects of prey depletion on predator populations and to ensure that management continues to follow a precautionary approach and is addressed at spatial and temporal scales relevant to ecosystem operation.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Warwick-Evans, V (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

It is found from the Subtropical Convergence southward to the coastal Antarctic Seas but being most abundant in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone. Low temperatures appear to negatively affect their development, limiting their ability to occur in the krill dominated high Antarctic ecosystems. Yet reports indicate that with ocean warming S. thompsoni have experienced a southward shift in their distribution. As they are efficient filter feeders, this shift can result in large-scale changes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem by increasing competitive or predatory interactions with Antarctic krill. To explore salp bloom dynamics in the Southern Ocean a size-structured S. thompsoni population model was developed with growth, consumption, reproduction and mortality rates dependent on temperature and chlorophyll a conditions. The largest uncertainties in S. thompsoni population ecology are individual and population growth rates, with a recent study identifying the possibility that the life cycle could be much shorter than previously considered. Here we run a suite of hypothesis scenarios under various environmental conditions to determine the most appropriate growth rate. Temperature and chlorophyll a were sufficient drivers to recreate seasonal and interannual dynamics of salp populations at two locations. The most suitable growth model suggests that mean S. thompsoni growth rates are likely to be similar to 1 mm body length d(-1), 2-fold higher than previous calculations. S. thompsoni biomass was dependent on bud release time, with larger biomass years corresponding to bud release occurring during favorable environmental conditions; increasing the survival and growth of blastozooids and resulting in higher embryo release. This model confirms that it is necessary for growth and reproductive rates to be flexible in order for the salp population to adapt to varying environmental conditions and provides a framework that can examine how future salp populations might respond to climate change.","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","Henschke, N (Corresponding Author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Ocean \& Atmospher Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

To understand the flexibility of Antarctic krill's seasonal cycle, we investigated its physiological and behavioural responses to different light regimes and if an endogenous timing system was involved in the regulation of these seasonal processes. We analysed growth, feeding, lipid content, and maturity in a 2-year laboratory experiment simulating the latitudinal light regimes at 52 degrees S and 66 degrees S and constant darkness under constant food level. Our results showed that light regime affected seasonal cycles of growth, feeding, lipid metabolism, and maturity in Antarctic krill. Seasonal patterns of growth, feeding, and maturity persisted under constant darkness, indicating the presence of an endogenous timing system. The maturity cycle showed differences in critical photoperiods according to the simulated latitudinal light regime. This suggests a flexible endogenous timing mechanism in Antarctic krill, which may determine its response to future environmental changes.","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA","English","Horing, F; Meyer, B (Corresponding Author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar \& Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Sect Polar Biol Oceanog, Handelshafen 12, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.

Using a non-invasive method (scats), the diet of non-breeding gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua at Bird Island, South Georgia, was examined during the winter of 2009 when local environmental conditions were abnormal (e.g. warmer sea surface waters). Scats were collected every 2 weeks from May until October 2009 (N = 168); the diet was dominated by the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii by frequency of occurrence (77.5\% of the samples) and by number (70.5\% of the total individuals). By mass, different species of crustaceans (T. gaudichaudii and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba) and fish (Champsocephalus gunnari, Lepidonotothen larseni and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus) were the most important in different periods. Numerically, prey switching occurred at the end of winter, when E. superba became more abundant in the penguins' diets in late September and early October (austral spring), when sea surface temperatures became colder. T. gaudichaudii is sub-optimal prey for gentoo penguins and its consumption most likely reflects a lack of E. superba in local waters. The consumption of T. gaudichaudii and fish, in place of E. superba, was probably insufficient for the penguins to maintain a body condition suitable for reproduction, contributing to the observed late commencement of breeding (i.e. 2-3 weeks) that year. Our results highlight the sensitivity of gentoo penguin populations to variations in environmental conditions, particularly in terms of how these conditions affect the availability of preferred dietary items and potential follow-on effects in the subsequent breeding season.","SPRINGER","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","English","Xavier, JC (Corresponding Author), Univ Coimbra, Marine \& Environm Sci MARE UC, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal.

Ice-associated (sympagic) microalgae could serve as a high-quality carbon source during winter, but their significance in the food web is so far unquantified. To better understand the importance of ice algae-produced carbon for the overwintering of Antarctic organisms, we investigated fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope compositions of 10 zooplankton species, and their potential sympagic and pelagic carbon sources. FA-specific carbon stable isotope compositions were used in stable isotope mixing models to quantify the contribution of ice algae-produced carbon ((Ice)) to the body carbon of each species. Mean (Ice) estimates ranged from 4\% to 67\%, with large variations between species and depending on the FA used for the modelling. Integrating the (Ice) estimates from all models, the sympagic amphipod Eusirus laticarpus was the most dependent on ice algal carbon ((Ice): 54\%-67\%), and the salp Salpa thompsoni showed the least dependency on ice algal carbon ((Ice): 8\%-40\%). Differences in (Ice) estimates between FAs associated with short-term vs. long-term lipid pools suggested an increasing importance of ice algal carbon for many species as the winter season progressed. In the abundant winter-active copepod Calanus propinquus, mean (Ice) reached more than 50\% in late winter. The trophic carbon flux from ice algae into this copepod was between 3 and 5mgCm(-2)day(-1). This indicates that copepods and other ice-dependent zooplankton species transfer significant amounts of carbon from ice algae into the pelagic system, where it fuels the food web, the biological carbon pump and elemental cycling. Understanding the role of ice algae-produced carbon in these processes will be the key to predictions of the impact of future sea ice decline on Antarctic ecosystem functioning.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Kohlbach, D (Corresponding Author), Fisheries \& Oceans Canada, Freshwater Inst, 501 Univ Crescent, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N6, Canada.

For chinstrap penguins, one of the most abundant krill predators breeding across the Antarctic Peninsula, we show that habitat models developed utilizing the distance from the colony and the bearing to the shelf-edge, adjusting for the at-sea density of Pygoscelis penguins from other colonies, can be used to predict, with a high level of confidence, the at-sea distribution of chinstrap penguins from untracked colonies during the breeding season. Comparison of predicted penguin distributions with outputs from a high-resolution oceanographic model shows that chinstrap penguins prefer nearshore habitats, over shallow bathymetry, with slow-flowing waters, but that they sometimes also travel to areas beyond the edge of the continental shelf where the faster-flowing waters of the Coastal Current or the fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current occur. In the slow-moving shelf waters, large penguin colonies may lead to krill depletion during incubation and chick-rearing periods when penguins are acting as central place foragers. The habitats used by chinstrap penguins are also locations preferentially used by the commercial krill fishery, one of the last under-developed marine capture fisheries anywhere on the planet. As it develops, this fishery has the potential to compete with chinstrap penguins and other natural krill predators. Scaling our habitat models by chinstrap penguin population data demonstrates where overlap with the fishery is likely to be most important. Our results suggest that a better understanding of krill retention and krill depletion in areas used by natural predators and by the krill fishery are needed, and that risk management strategies for the fishery should include assessment of how krill movement can satisfy the demands of both natural predators and the fishery across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Such information will help regional management authorities better understand how plausible ecosystem-based management frameworks could be developed to ensure sustainable co-existence of the fishery and competing natural predators.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Trathan, PN (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

Hence, there is strong interest in identifying the biological and physical factors influencing the distribution and abundance of prey species, which may be of broad predictive use for conservation planning and evaluating effects of environmental change. This study focuses on a key Southern Ocean prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, using acoustic observations of individual swarms (aggregations) from a large-scale survey off East Antarctica. We developed two sets of statistical models describing swarm characteristics, one set using underway survey data for the explanatory variables, and the other using their satellite remotely sensed analogues. While survey data are in situ and contemporaneous with the swarm data, remotely sensed data are all that is available for prediction and inference about prey distribution in other areas or at other times. The fitted models showed that the primary biophysical influences on krill swarm characteristics included daylight (solar elevation/radiation) and proximity to the Antarctic continental slope, but there were also complex relationships with current velocities and gradients. Overall model performance was similar regardless of whether underway or remotely sensed predictors were used. We applied the latter models to generate regional-scale spatial predictions using a 10-yr remotely-sensed time series. This retrospective modelling identified areas off east Antarctica where relatively dense krill swarms were consistently predicted during austral mid-summers, which may underpin key foraging areas for marine predators. Spatiotemporal predictions along Antarctic predator satellite tracks, from independent studies, illustrate the potential for uptake into further quantitative modelling of predator movements and foraging. The approach is widely applicable to other krill-dependent ecosystems, and our findings are relevant to similar efforts examining biophysical linkages elsewhere in the Southern Ocean and beyond.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Bestley, S (Corresponding Author), Australian Antarctic Div, Kingston, Tas, Australia.

Isotopic values in serially sampled whiskers of 34 leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx, HL), 13 crabeater (Lobodon carcinophaga, LC) and 14 Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii, LW) seals were measured. Two clusters of leopard seals were identified based on their delta N-15 values: a high-trophic level group (HLhigh) and a low-trophic level group (HLlow). Overlap in SEAc was only seen between HL and LC, while HL and LW showed an overlap in their convex hulls, but no overlap in SEAc. Diet compositions estimated using Bayesian stable isotope mixing models revealed intra- and interspecific differences among seals. For leopard seals highest dietary contributor was krill, while for HLhigh krill and fish cephalopod were the main contributors. Mixing models run separately for each HL seal showed a large variation in the proportional contribution of krill (12-90\%) compared to the other sources (cephalopods, fish, penguins and seals). The crabeater seals almost exclusively consumed krill, with a low contribution of the other prey. Weddell seals, on the other hand, showed a high proportion of fish and a lower contribution of cephalopods and penguins, while the contribution of krill seemed to be minimal. This study is the first to compare isotopic niches of three Antarctic seals from the WAP. Our results indicate that crabeater and leopard seals seem to have a strong and a considerable dependence on krill, respectively. Although the WAP is characterized by an unusually high production of Antarctic krill the large community of vertebrate predators that feed upon this resource (penguins, seals and baleen whales) should be especially vulnerable under future scenarios of reduction of krill biomass. Under the current drastic environmental changes in the WAP, continuing to monitor WAP seal diets and the relative contribution of krill to them will help understand the degree to which climate change may alter the population dynamics of these upper trophic level species.","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","English","Botta, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Oceanog, Lab Ecol \& Conservacao Megafauna Marinha, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.

Euphausiids play a crucial role in the trophodynamics of the ecosystem, and their status under future environmental scenarios is the subject of much concern. Thysanoessa macrura is the most widely distributed, numerically abundant, and ubiquitous euphausiid south of the Polar Front and may be an underappreciated prey species. T. macrura is eurythermic and may be better able to tolerate warming ocean temperatures in comparison to the more stenothermic Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We use temperature-dependent growth models and biomass per recruit to investigate how the availability of this euphausiid to predators may change under a range of temperature scenarios. We contrast this with the availability of E. superba and find that, under some ranges of temperature change, increasing T. macrura growth may be able to partially compensate for decreasing E. superba growth in terms of biomass available for predators. However, in spite of its considerable biomass, other aspects of this species, such as its size and habitat, may limit its potential to replace E. superba in the diet of many predators.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Richerson, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math \& Stat, Ctr Stock Assessment Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.

We used a minimally realistic ecosystem model to examine how projected effects of ocean warming on the growth of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, might affect populations of krill and dependent predators (whales, penguins, seals, and fish) in the Scotia Sea. We also investigated the potential to mitigate depletion risk for predators by curtailing krill fishing at different points in the 21st century. The projected effects of ocean warming on krill biomass were strongest in the northern Scotia Sea, with a >= 40\% decline in the mass of individual krill. Projections also suggest a 25\% chance that krill biomass will fall below an established depletion threshold (75\% of its unimpacted level), with consequent risks for some predator populations, especially penguins. Average penguin abundance declined by up to 30\% of its unimpacted level, with up to a 50\% chance of falling below the depletion threshold. Simulated krill fishing at currently permitted harvest rates further increased risks for depletion, and stopping fishing offset the increased risks associated with ocean warming in our model to some extent. These results varied by location and species group. Risk reductions at smaller spatial scales also differed from those at the regional level, which suggests that some predator populations may be more vulnerable than others to future changes in krill biomass. However, impacts on predators did not always map directly to those for krill. Our findings indicate the importance of identifying vulnerable marine populations and targeting protection measures at appropriate spatial scales, and the potential for spatially-structured management to avoid aggravating risks associated with rising ocean temperatures. This may help balance tradeoffs among marine ecosystem services in an uncertain future.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Klein, ES (Corresponding Author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92038 USA.

While previous research demonstrated connections between multiple pelagic trophic levels and the physics of the sea ice, few studies have assessed the sea ice ecosystem or its linkage to the ocean ecosystem in this region. Through a field survey and shipboard experiments, our study focused on characterizing the spring ice algal bloom and elucidating its role in seeding phytoplankton communities postice melt in high and low light conditions. Field data revealed that algal communities in slush layers, often formed from the flooding of seawater (infiltration layers), dominated biomass distributions in the sea ice throughout the region, and showed distinct photophysiological characteristics from interior or bottom ice communities. Sea ice algal biomass reached 120 mg chl a m(-2) and was often dominated by Phaeocystis antarctica. Shipboard growth experiments showed that prior light history (ice or water column), rather than community composition (phytoplankton and ice algae were composed of similar taxa), primarily drove physiological responses to high and low light. P. antarctica generally dominated the community in growth experiments at the end of the 6 d incubation period. Settling column experiments suggested that P. antarctica's higher sinking rates relative to other taxa may explain its minor contributions to the summer phytoplankton community in single-cell form and its absence in colonial form, observed in the long-term ecological record of this region.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Selz, V (Corresponding Author), Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.

Decreases in krill abundance could result in a major ecological regime shift, but there is limited information on how climate change may affect krill. Increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are causing ocean acidification, as absorption of atmospheric CO2 in seawater alters ocean chemistry. Ocean acidification increases mortality and negatively affects physiological functioning in some marine invertebrates, and is predicted to occur most rapidly at high latitudes. Here we show that, in the laboratory, adult krill are able to survive, grow, store fat, mature, and maintain respiration rates when exposed to near-future ocean acidification (1000-2000 mu atm pCO(2)) for one year. Despite differences in seawater pCO(2) incubation conditions, adult krill are able to actively maintain the acid-base balance of their body fluids in near-future pCO(2), which enhances their resilience to ocean acidification.","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA","English","Ericson, JA (Corresponding Author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine \& Antarctic Studies, 20 Castray Esplanade, Battery Point, Tas 7004, Australia.

Reliable assessments of how this mass depletion impacted whale populations, and projections of their recovery, are crucial but there are uncertainties regarding the status of Southern Hemisphere whale populations. We developed a Southern Hemisphere spatial Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments (MICE) for phytoplankton, krill (Euphausia superba) and five baleen whale species, to estimate whale population trajectories from 1890 to present. To forward project to 2100, we couple the predator-prey model to a global climate model. We used the most up to date catch records, fitted to survey data and accounted for key uncertainties. We predict Antarctic blue (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia), fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and southern right (Eubalaena australis) whales will be at less than half their pre-exploitation numbers (K) even given 100years of future protection from whaling, because of slow growth rates. Some species have benefited greatly from cessation of harvesting, particularly humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae), currently at 32\% of K, with full recovery predicted by 2050. We highlight spatial differences in the recovery of whale species between oceanic areas, with current estimates of Atlantic/Indian area blue (1,890, <1\% of K) and fin (16,950, <4\% of K) whales suggesting slower recovery from harvesting, whilst Pacific southern right numbers are <7\% of K (2,680). Antarctic minke (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) population trajectories track future expected increases in primary productivity. Population estimates and plausible future predicted trajectories for Southern Hemisphere baleen whales are key requirements for management and conservation.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Tulloch, VJD (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.

"88","Devi","No","incollection","McQuaid, Christopher D.","IMPLICATIONS OF LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE FOR BIOGEOGRAPHY AND ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN",NA,"2018","56",NA,"Understanding the long-term consequences of climate change for Southern Ocean ecosystems is important because this is one of the last remaining wildernesses on the planet and because the Southern Ocean is a major driver of global climate. The Southern Ocean is roughly the size of Africa and experiences exceptional seasonality. Its many habitats include the permanently open ocean, sea ice, frontal systems and neritic waters, and different zonal (east-west) and meridional (north-south) regions are on different trajectories in terms of climate, sea ice cover and biological populations. The Western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced substantial warming, loss of sea ice and declining Adelie penguin populations, while eastern Antarctica has cooled, shown increased ice cover and increasing numbers of Adelies. In the ocean itself, warming seems to be concentrated north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and at depth rather than in surface waters. Densities of Antarctic krill are correlated with ice cover in the previous winter and in the south-west Atlantic have decreased over the last century while salps have shown increasing numbers south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Even in this example, the mechanisms involved are uncertain, making predictions difficult. The historic loss of an enormous biomass of consumers through fisheries, led to top- down ecological effects including competitive release among predators. These pelagic food webs are, however, strongly physically forced, making them particularly vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions. The size and species composition of the primary producers affect food chain length and the efficiency of the biological pump. Critically, the primary producer community is profoundly shaped by factors influencing the availability of light (e.g. season, ice melt and water column stability), micro and macronutrients. Changes in these will have deeply important bottom-up effects, and this brings us to defining biogeography. In these pelagic systems, biogeographic provinces are defined by the frontal systems that delineate sharp discontinuities in conditions in the water column and the taxa that dominate primary production. Because these are not geographically fixed, changes in biogeography in this context describe the expansion, contraction or simple displacement of biomes. The associated food webs revolve around a small number of key species that differ among habitats and biomes. They are not simple, exhibit considerable flexibility and include a number of taxa, particularly the cephalopods, that are difficult to sample and remain poorly studied. A major difficulty in understanding how climate change is likely to manifest is the brevity of relevant datasets. We have few physical or biological benchmarks to use in separating short-term noise from long-term signal. As a physical example, Southern Ocean fronts can exhibit short-term meridional shifts of >100 km in a matter of weeks. Biologically, regional differences in trajectories of Adelie penguin numbers need to be viewed against the background of substantial variability over the last 45,000 years. Except for ice or sediment cores, such data are available for few variables or species. In addition, research efforts are geographically unbalanced for logistic reasons. Remote sensing and the Argo float programme reduce this problem by increasing spatial coverage enormously for some variables, but not others, and even then offer relatively new time series. Important variables that are undergoing, or will undergo, change include: sea ice cover (essentially habitat loss), sea temperatures, wind and mixing regimes, the positions of fronts, ultraviolet levels and ocean pH. Many of these will have interacting effects, and the areas likely to be exposed to multiple environmental changes far exceed those already experiencing important changes. Species are potentially vulnerable to stressors at all ontogenetic stages and in many cases sublethal effects (e.g. on reproductive success) are likely to affect population dynamics before stressors reach lethal levels. Likely, and complicated, will be possible changes to the microbial plankton, including increased microbe deposition by aeolian dust and greater susceptibility of potential hosts to viral infection because of other stresses. All these stressors can have direct and interacting effects as well as indirect effects. For example, meridional shifts in frontal positions will alter the foraging ranges of top predators that are land-based during the breeding season. The ecosystem-level consequences will depend on individual species reactions, including the rates at which they can respond and stressors to which they respond, with the potential disruption of species interactions through different phenological responses. Perhaps the key characteristic of predictions for the effects of climate change on the Southern Ocean lies in an even greater degree of uncertainty than the norm.","CRC PRESS-TAYLOR \& FRANCIS GROUP","6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA","English","McQuaid, CD (Corresponding Author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool \& Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.

Distributions of these species were constructed from observations made in the western Ross Sea from 1988 to 2004. Distributions of environmental conditions were obtained from a 5-km resolution circulation model (temperature, mixed layer depth, surface speed) and satellite-derived observations (chlorophyll, sea ice cover). A hierarchy of statistical methods determined correlations and relationships between species and environmental conditions. Each species occupies a localized habitat defined by different environmental characteristics. Antarctic krill are concentrated along the northwestern shelf break in a habitat characterized by deep (>1000 m) bottom depth, warm temperature (1 to 1.25 degrees C), decreased sea ice, and proximity to the shelf break. Crystal krill and Antarctic silverfish are concentrated in Terra Nova Bay. Common characteristics of the habitat for these species are southwesterly location, coastal proximity, and cold temperature (-1.75 to -2 degrees C). The habitat characteristics obtained for the 3 species provide a basis for projecting potential distribution changes in response to environmental change and for delineating regions of the Ross Sea for focused management and selection of marine protected areas that support ecosystem-level conservation plans.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Davis, LB (Corresponding Author), Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA 23508 USA.

We used shipboard surveys over nine years to investigate environmental determinants of seabird hotspots near the Antarctic Peninsula, a region experiencing rapid climate change and an expanding krill fishery. We hypothesize that seabird hotspots are structured by mesoscale ocean conditions that reflect differences in prey distribution within oceanic and coastal waters. We used generalized additive models to quantify functional relationships of seabird hotspots with krill biomass, and a suite of remotely sensed environmental variables, such as eddy kinetic energy. The spatial organization, changes in intensity, and distribution shifts of seabird hotspots indicate different environmental drivers within coastal and oceanic domains and reflect the seasonal variability of the ecosystem. Our results indicate at least eight mesoscale hotspot zones that represent ecologically important areas where significant krill and predator biomass may be concentrated. Our ecosystem assessment of seabird hotspots identified critical foraging habitat and provided reference points to benefit research on estimating their trophic impacts on Antarctic ecosystems and potential effects from the krill fishery. Our approach is generally applicable to other pelagic ecosystems that are structured by hydrographic fronts and eddies, and containing schooling forage species shared by multiple wide-ranging predators. Furthermore, identification of biological hotspots is useful for the designation of marine protected areas most critical to potentially endangered wildlife and fisheries resources.","SPRINGER","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","English","Santora, JA (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Stock Assessment Res, Dept Appl Math \& Stat, 110 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.

Future ocean and sea-ice changes affecting the distribution of such species will impact the structure and functioning of whole ecosystems. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species in Southern Ocean food webs, but there is little understanding of the factors influencing its success throughout much of the ocean. The capacity of a habitat to maintain growth will be crucial and here we use an empirical relationship of growth rate to assess seasonal spatial variability. Over much of the ocean, potential for growth is limited, with three restricted oceanic regions where seasonal conditions permit high growth rates, and only a few areas around the Scotia Sea and Antarctic Peninsula suitable for growth of the largest krill (> 60 mm). Our study demonstrates that projections of impacts of future change need to account for spatial and seasonal variability of key ecological processes within ocean ecosystems.","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","English","Murphy, EJ (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge, England.

Seasonal upwelling brings low pH water to the surface along the Pacific Coast of North America. In Monterey Bay, California Euphausia pacifica, a key species supporting a diverse multi-trophic-level ecosystem, currently experiences broad pCO(2) and pH ranges due to both diel vertical migrations and seasonal upwelling. We determined tolerances of E. pacifica to prolonged exposure to pH levels predicted for 2100 by maintaining adults at two pCO(2) levels (380 and 1200 mu atm) for 2 months. Rates of survival and moulting were the same at both pCO(2) levels. High pCO2 slowed growth in all size classes. In additional experiments to determine pCO2 threshold levels above which E. pacifica is adversely affected, survival was not affected down to pH 6.96 (6050 mu atm), but declined rapidly at pH 6.92 (7228 mu atm) and lower, with 100\% mortality within 10 d at pH 6.89.","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","English","Cooper, HL (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol \& Evolutionary Biol, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.

Research cruises conducted around the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic Peninsula during winters with contrasting ice conditions provide the first acoustic estimates of krill biomass, habitat use, and association with top predators to examine potential interactions with the krill fishery. Krill abundance was very low in offshore waters during all winters. In Bransfield Strait, median krill abundance was an order of magnitude higher (8 krill m(-2)) compared to summer (0.25 krill m(-2)), and this pattern was ob served in all winters regardless of ice cover. Acoustic estimates of krill biomass were also an order of magnitude higher (similar to 5 500 000 metric tons {[}t] in 2014) than a 15 yr summer average (520 000 t). Looking at krill-dependent predators, during winter, crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus were concentrated in Brans-field Strait where ice provided habitat, while Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella were more broadly distributed. Krill overwinter in coastal basin environments independent of ice and primary production and in an area that is becoming more frequently ice-free. While long-term projections of climate change have focused on changing krill habitat and productivity declines, more immediate impacts of ongoing climate change include increased risks of negative fishery-krill-predator interactions, alteration of upper trophic level community structure, and changes in the pelagic ecology of this system. Development of management strategies to mitigate the increased risk to krill populations and their dependent predators over management timescales will be necessary to minimize the impacts of long-term climate change.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Reiss, CS (Corresponding Author), Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.

We use acoustic data collected from 1997 to 2011 around the South Shetland Islands near the northern Antarctic Peninsula to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in krill biomass, distribution, and patchiness both within and across years. Moreover, we evaluate potential climate drivers of krill biomass and spatial organization through comparison with seasonally lagged climate indices. Krill abundance varied by an order of magnitude throughout the study period, with mean biomass ranging from a high of 171.9 g m(-2) in 1997 to a low of 9.4 g m(-2) in 2002. We find that across years, krill abundance and variability are correlated with seasonally averaged measures of El Nio-Southern Oscillation at lags of approximately 2-2.5 years, which may correspond to strong reproduction and recruitment events. Krill biomass shows generally weak to moderate spatial autocorrelation and high aggregation, with measures of spatial organization correlated with abundance in some habitats. Within years, there was an overall trend of declining krill abundance and/or detectability and contracted spatial distribution between midsummer and late summer, but this pattern was not consistent across all years. This synthesis provides the background to model krill prey landscapes in order to better understand regional foraging ecology of krill predators and fishery performance.","SPRINGER","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","English","Richerson, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math \& Stat, Ctr Stock Assessment Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.

The band counts in these individuals were either identical to their absolute ages, or only failed to agree by a few months, which demonstrates the accuracy of this method. Precision and bias were estimated graphically using Chang's index (Coefficient of Variation = 5.03\%). High accuracy and precision between readers and low ageing bias indicate that longitudinal sections of eyestalks can be used to age krill in wild samples and to develop age-based stock assessment models for krill. Archival samples preserved in formalin (5\%) and stored in ambient conditions were also readable. Ageing preserved krill will provide the opportunity to examine changes in growth among krill populations within the Southern Ocean and to retrospectively examine changes in krill production over the last century to better understand the historical and future impacts of climate change on this critical Southern Ocean species.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Reiss, CS (Corresponding Author), NOAA Fisheries, Antarctic Ecosyst Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.

The future resilience of krill to climate change depends critically on the winter survival of young krill. To survive periods of extremely low production by pelagic algae during winter, krill are assumed to rely partly on carbon produced by ice algae. The true dependency on ice algae-produced carbon, however, is so far unquantified. This confounds predictions on the future resilience of krill stocks to sea ice decline. Fatty acid (FA) analysis, bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA), and compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of diatom- and dinoflagellate-associated marker FAs were applied to quantify the dependency of overwintering larval, juvenile, and adult krill on ice algae-produced carbon (alpha(ice)) during winter 2013 in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone. Our results demonstrate that the majority of the carbon uptake of the overwintering larval and juvenile krill originated from ice algae (up to 88\% of the carbon budget), and that the dependency on ice algal carbon decreased with ontogeny, reaching 56\% of the carbon budget in adults. Spatio-temporal variability in the utilization of ice algal carbon was more pronounced in larvae and juvenile krill than in adults. Differences between uice estimates derived from short- vs. long-term FA-specific isotopic compositions suggested that ice algae-produced carbon gained importance as the winter progressed, and might become critical at the late winter-spring transition, before the phytoplankton bloom commences. Where the sea ice season shortens, reduced availability of ice algae might possibly not be compensated by surplus phytoplankton production during wintertime. Hence, sea ice decline could seriously endanger the winter survival of recruits, and subsequently overall biomass of krill.","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","English","Kohlbach, D (Corresponding Author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar \& Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Polar Biol Oceanog, Bremerhaven, Germany.

Lithogenic particles deriving from aeolian dust deposition, glacial runoff, or river discharges can form an important source if the attached iron becomes dissolved and therefore bioavailable {[}3-5]. Acidic digestion by zooplankton is a potential mechanism for iron mobilization {[}6], but evidence is lacking. Here we show that Antarctic krill sampled near glacial outlets at the island of South Georgia (Southern Ocean) ingest large amounts of lithogenic particles and contain 3-fold higher iron concentrations in their muscle than specimens from offshore, which confirms mineral dissolution in their guts. About 90\% of the lithogenic and biogenic iron ingested by krill is passed into their fecal pellets, which contain 5-fold higher proportions of labile (reactive) iron than intact diatoms. The mobilized iron can be released in dissolved form directly from krill or via multiple pathways involving microbes, other zooplankton, and krill predators. This can deliver substantial amounts of bioavailable iron and contribute to the fertilization of coastal waters and the ocean beyond. In line with our findings, phytoplankton blooms downstream of South Georgia are more intensive and longer lasting during years with high krill abundance on-shelf. Thus, krill crop phytoplankton but boost new production via their nutrient supply. Understanding and quantifying iron mobilization by zooplankton is essential to predict ocean productivity in a warming climate where lithogenic iron inputs from deserts, glaciers, and rivers are increasing [}7-10].","CELL PRESS","50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","English","Schmidt, K; Atkinson, A (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

However, there are no circumpolar assessments of available habitat for larval krill, making it difficult to evaluate how climate change may impact this life stage. We use outputs from a circumpolar sea ice model, together with a set of simple assumptions regarding key habitat features, to identify possible regions of larval krill habitat around Antarctica during winter. We assume that the location and suitability of habitat is determined by both food availability and three-dimensional complexity of the sea ice. A comparison of the combined area of these regions under current conditions with a warm climate scenario indicates that while total areal sea ice extent decreases, there is a consistently larger area of potential larval krill habitat under warm conditions. These findings suggest that decreases in sea ice extent may not necessarily be detrimental for krill populations.","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","English","Melbourne-Thomas, J (Corresponding Author), Australian Antarctic Div, Dept Environm, Kingston, Tas, Australia.

Here we use the Framework on Ocean Observing (FOO) to begin developing ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (eEOVs) for the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). An eEOV is a defined biological or ecological quantity, which is derived from field observations,, and which contributes significantly to assessments of Southern Ocean ecosystems. Here, assessments are concerned with estimating status and trends in ecosystem properties, attribution of trends to causes, and predicting future trajectories. eEOVs should be feasible to collect at appropriate spatial and temporal scales and are useful to the extent that they contribute to direct estimation of trends and/or attribution, and/or development of ecological (statistical or simulation) models to support assessments. In this paper we outline the rationale, including establishing a set of criteria, for selecting eEOVs for the SOOS and develop a list of candidate eEOVs for further evaluation. Other than habitat variables, nine types of eEOVs for Southern Ocean taxa are identified within three classes: state (magnitude, genetic/species, size spectrum), predator-prey (diet, foraging range), and autecology (phenology, reproductive rate, individual growth rate, detritus). Most candidates for the suite of Southern Ocean taxa relate to state or diet. Candidate autecological eEOVs have not been developed other than for marine mammals and birds. We consider some of the spatial and temporal issues that will influence the adoption and use of eEOVs in an observing system in the Southern Ocean, noting that existing operations and platforms potentially provide coverage of the four main sectors of the region the East and West Pacific, Atlantic and Indian. Lastly, we discuss the importance of simulation modelling in helping with the design of the observing system in the long term. Regional boundary: south of 30 degrees S. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Projected future changes for the krill habitat include a sustained increase in ocean temperature and changes in sea ice and chlorophyll a. Here we investigate how these factors affect the early life history of krill and identify the regions around Antarctica where the impact will be greatest. Our tool is a temperature-dependent krill growth model forced by data from comprehensive greenhouse warming simulations. We find that by the year 2100 localized regions along the western Weddell Sea, isolated areas of the Indian Antarctic , and the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea will support successful spawning habitats for krill. The failure of potentially successful spawning will have a strong impact on the already declining adult populations with consequences for the Antarctic marine food web, having both ecological and commercial ramifications.","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","English","Pinones, A (Corresponding Author), Yale Univ, Dept Geol \& Geophys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.

Where prey distributions are unpredictable and ephemeral, seabirds may gain up-to-date information by monitoring the direction of birds returning to the colony or by monitoring the foraging behavior of other birds through local enhancement. However, search strategies based on social information may require high population densities, raising concerns about the potential loss of information in declining populations. Our objectives were to explore the mechanisms that underpin effective search strategies based on social information under a range of population densities and different foraging conditions. Testing relevant hypotheses through field observation is challenging because of limitations in the ability to manipulate population densities and foraging conditions. We therefore developed a spatially explicit individual-based foraging model, informed by data on the movement and foraging patterns of seabirds foraging on pelagic prey, and used model simulations to investigate the mechanisms underpinning search strategies. Orientation of outbound headings in line with returning birds enables departing birds to avoid areas without prey even at relatively low population densities. The mechanisms underpinning local enhancement are more effective as population densities increase and may be facilitated by other mechanisms that concentrate individuals in profitable areas. For seabirds and other central place foragers foraging on unpredictable and ephemeral food resources, information is especially valuable when resources are spatially concentrated and may play an important role in mitigating poor foraging conditions.","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","English","Boyd, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat \& Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) dominated the diet of Adelie and gentoo penguins in all three studied stages (pre-breeding, breeding and post-breeding). Nevertheless, only in gentoo penguins a shift in the diet was evident from mainly krill during the breeding stage to mixed diet (i.e. krill and fish/squids) during the pre-and post-breeding stages. Results from stable isotopes suggest that Adelie penguins might be foraging in southern localities compared to their congener during the inter-breeding period. Moreover, Adelie penguins showed a large individual variability in foraging habitat during the post-breeding stage. However, our model has predicted that both species exploited similar areas during the breeding season. The results obtained during the chick-rearing stage were compared with the stomach contents of both species obtained during the same season (2011/2012). Our findings provide new knowledge on the feeding ecology and foraging habitats of pygoscelid penguins. They confirm the importance of Antarctic krill during the annual cycle and improve the understanding of life strategies and predator-prey interactions essentially out of the reproductive period, in which the information is very limited. These results can help to establish new management strategies, particularly considering the potential overlap between predators and fisheries.","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","English","Juares, MA (Corresponding Author), Inst Antartico Argentino, Dept Biol Predadores Tope, Balcarce 290,C1064AAF, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.

Many whale populations are still depleted due to 20th century whaling. Whales are one of the most logistically difficult and expensive animals to study because of their mobility, pelagic lifestyle and often remote habitat. We tackle the question of population structure in the Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) - a critically endangered subspecies and the largest extant animal - by capitalizing on the largest genetic dataset to date for Antarctic blue whales. We found evidence of three populations that are sympatric in the Antarctic feeding grounds and likely occupy separate breeding grounds. Our study adds to knowledge of population structure in the Antarctic blue whale. Future research should invest in locating the breeding grounds and migratory routes of Antarctic blue whales through satellite telemetry to confirm their population structure and allow population-level conservation.","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","English","Attard, CRM (Corresponding Author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.

Laboratory studies have also greatly increased knowledge about intrinsic and extrinsic factors governing growth and moulting frequency that have been used to develop more robust models for krill growth. These findings have demonstrated the plasticity of krill life history and can provide the foundation for understanding krill population response to future climate change.

With nearly a century of observations on krill distribution, the general patterns of occurrence were determined over 50 years ago, however the last decade has seen an important consolidation of details of seasonal and inter-annual distributions, although some potentially important krill habitats such as the Bellingshausen, Amundsen and Ross Seas are still poorly sampled. Moreover the unexplored perennial multi-year pack-ice regions still await survey by remote under-ice samplers. Krill consistently occur in the upper 200 m of the ocean but various recent observations show that a substantial proportion of the population may be found below this pelagic zone. To further understand variability and change there has been a focus on the importance of historic data with the compilation of comprehensive databases, re-analysis of large scale synoptic surveys and the generation of smaller scale time series that now span several decades. In particular the compilation of 90 years of net samples has provided a key resource both in showing changes in large-scale abundance over the last 50 years and together with acoustic data in generating modern estimates of overall krill abundance and biomass. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of ocean circulation models together with remotely sensed data, has enabled the exploration of large-scale teleconnections at both the regional (Scotia Sea) and circum-polar scale and at the seasonal to decadal time scales.","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","Siegel, V (Corresponding Author), Thuenen Inst Sea Fisheries, Palmaille 9, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany.

Species-specific growth rate responses to environmental variability may affect populations through changes in reproductive potential; therefore, measuring spatial and temporal variability in growth rates of highly abundant zooplankton is critical to predict the impact of climate change on pelagic ecosystems. Here, we used length frequencies from bi-annual surveys conducted 1 month apart to estimate growth rates of one the most abundant euphausiids in the Southern Ocean, Thysanoessa macrura. We analyzed summer data from 4 separate years (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004) that varied widely in temperature and primary production. Stations within the surveys were grouped by water characteristics: warm, low salinity Antarctic Circum polar Current (ACC) water, and cold, saline Bransfield Strait and Weddell Sea (MBW) water, to assess inter-annual and spatial variability in cohort growth. Mid-summer cohort growth rates of T. macrura varied between years and water masses, ranging from -0.037 mm d(-1) in MBW water in 2004 to 0.081 mm d(-1) in ACC water in 1995. Growth rates were faster in ACC water than in MBW water during all years. Growth rates were strongly correlated with temperature (R-2 = 0.82) but weakly correlated with copepod density (R-2 = 0.38), and were not correlated with chl a concentration (R-2 = 0.11). These results suggest that the growth rates of T. macrura may increase in regions exhibiting warming trends, such as the Antarctic Peninsula. This contrasts with published data on the growth rates of Euphausia superba, which is predicted to be impacted negatively by climate warming.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Driscoll, RM (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.

Using biological data collected during 14 shipboard surveys off the northern Antarctic Peninsula and oceanographic data from satellite remote sensing, we mapped the distribution of fin whale hotspots, Antarctic krill abundance (biomass from acoustics, concentrations from nets) and ocean conditions during mid- and late-summer to investigate the environmental determinants of whale hotspots. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to test the hypothesis that intra-seasonal changes in fin whale hotspot distribution relate to sea surface temperature (SST), krill abundance and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). More whale hotspots (sightings and individuals) are observed during late- than mid-summer surveys. During mid-summer, hotspots occurred near Elephant Island while in late-summer they were distributed throughout the slope region in proximity to the mean location of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The spatial mean of EKE did not differ between mid- and late-summer surveys, but the spatial mean of SST was significantly warmer during late-summer. The GAM for mid-summer indicates that fin whale hotspots were positively related to SST, EKE and acoustically determined krill biomass. The GAM for late-summer indicates the hotspots were negatively related to net-based krill abundance and positively related to acoustic krill biomass and EKE. This study is important because environmental determinants of fin whale hotspots may be used as reference points for implementing future conservation plans for their recovering populations.","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","English","Santora, JA (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Stock Assessment Res, 110 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.

Here we use over two decades of data collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER) to determine how large-scale climate and local physical forcing affect phytoplankton, zooplankton and an apex predator along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We show that positive anomalies in chlorophyll-a (chl-a) at Palmer Station, occurring every 4-6 years, are constrained by physical processes in the preceding winter/spring and a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Favorable conditions for phytoplankton included increased winter ice extent and duration, reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water column stability via enhanced salinity-driven density gradients. Years of positive chl-a anomalies are associated with the initiation of a robust krill cohort the following summer, which is evident in Adelie penguin diets, thus demonstrating tight trophic coupling. Projected climate change in this region may have a significant, negative impact on phytoplankton biomass, krill recruitment and upper trophic level predators in this coastal Antarctic ecosystem.","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","English","Saba, GK (Corresponding Author), Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine \& Coastal Sci, 71 Dudley Rd, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.

Microbial communities inhabiting sea ice ecosystems currently contribute 10-50\% of the annual primary production of polar seas, supporting overwintering zooplankton species, especially Antarctic krill, and seeding spring phytoplankton blooms. Ocean acidification is occurring in all surface waters but the strongest effects will be experienced in polar ecosystems with significant effects on all trophic levels. Brine algae collected from McMurdo Sound (Antarctica) sea ice was incubated in situ under various carbonate chemistry conditions. The carbon chemistry was manipulated with acid, bicarbonate and bases to produce a pCO(2) and pH range from 238 to 6066 mu atm and 7.19 to 8.66, respectively. Elevated pCO(2) positively affected the growth rate of the brine algal community, dominated by the unique ice dinoflagellate, Polarella glacialis. Growth rates were significantly reduced when pH dropped below 7.6. However, when the pH was held constant and the pCO(2) increased, growth rates of the brine algae increased by more than 20\% and showed no decline at pCO(2) values more than five times current ambient levels. We suggest that projected increases in seawater pCO(2), associated with OA, will not adversely impact brine algal communities.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","McMinn, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine \& Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.

At the beginning of GLOBEC, the prevailing bottom-up forcing hypothesis was that climate-induced changes in vertical transport modulated nutrient supply and surface primary productivity, which in turn affected the lower trophic levels (e.g., zooplankton) and higher trophic levels (e.g., fish) through the trophic cascade. Although upwelling dynamics were confirmed to be an important driver of ecosystem variability in GLOBEC studies, the use of eddy-resolving regional-scale ocean circulation models combined with field observations revealed that horizontal advection is an equally important driver of marine ecosystem variability. Through a synthesis of studies from the four US GLOBEC regions (Gulf of Alaska, Northern California Current, Northwest Atlantic, and Southern Ocean), a new horizontal-advection bottom-up forcing paradigm emerges in which large-scale climate forcing drives regional changes in alongshore and cross-shelf ocean transport that directly impact ecosystem functions (e.g., productivity, species composition, spatial connectivity). The horizontal advection bottom-up forcing paradigm expands the mechanistic pathways through which climate variability and climate change impact the marine ecosystem. In particular, these results highlight the need for future studies to resolve and understand the role of mesoscale and submesoscale transport processes and their relationship to climate.","OCEANOGRAPHY SOC","P.O.

The transport and fate of the embryo and larva under present and modified conditions was investigated with Lagrangian particle tracking simulations. The two modeling studies were implemented using temperature and density (embryo larva model) and circulation distributions (Lagrangian particle tracking) obtained from a high resolution version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the wAP shelf region. Additional simulations used temperature and circulation distributions obtained from simulations that were forced with increased wind speed and increased transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), both projected to possibly occur with climate change in the wAP region. Simulations using present conditions showed that successful completion of the descent ascent cycle occurred along the outer shelf and on the shelf in regions with bottom depths of 600-700 m. Estimated residence times for the shelf regions that support success of the embryo and larva were 20-30 days. Thus, krill spawned in the mid and inner shelf regions can be retained in these regions through development to the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1). Increased winds and ACC transport resulted in more onshelf transport of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which increased the volume of warm (1-1.5 degrees C) water at depth. These conditions supported a moderate increase in success of the krill embryo and larva, but only for limited areas of the shelf where hatching depths decreased by 10-30 m (<5\%) and development time to the calyptopis 1 stage decreased by 15-20\%. The modified circulation conditions also supported increased advection of krill larvae into areas of the shelf that would experience the largest reduction of sea ice, especially in winter. Projected changes in wind strength and COW transport may potentially enhance larval survival and advection onto the wAP shelf, but recruitment may be decreased by modifications to local sea ice distributions that would impede survival of Antarctic krill that overwinter on the shelf.

Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; hereafter krill) is the key pelagic species of the region and its largest fishery resource(2). There is therefore concern about the combined effects of climate change, ocean acidification and an expanding fishery on krill and ultimately, their dependent predators-whales, seals and penguins(3,4). However, little is known about the sensitivity of krill to ocean acidification. Juvenile and adult krill are already exposed to variable seawater carbonate chemistry because they occupy a range of habitats and migrate both vertically and horizontally on a daily and seasonal basis(5). Moreover, krill eggs sink from the surface to hatch at 700-1,000m (ref. 6), where the carbon dioxide partial pressure (p(CO2)) in sea water is already greater than it is in the atmosphere(7). Krill eggs sink passively and so cannot avoid these conditions. Here we describe the sensitivity of krill egg hatch rates to increased CO2, and present a circumpolar risk map of krill hatching success under projected p(CO2) levels. We find that important krill habitats of the Weddell Sea and the Haakon VII Sea to the east are likely to become high-risk areas for krill recruitment within a century. Furthermore, unless CO2 emissions are mitigated, the Southern Ocean krill population could collapse by 2300 with dire consequences for the entire ecosystem.","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","English","Kawaguchi, S (Corresponding Author), Australian Antarctic Div, Channel Highway, Kingston, Tas 7050, Australia.

The fishery and the summer foraging sites of many of these predators are concentrated between 0 degrees and 90 degrees W. Parts of this quadrant have experienced recent localised sea surface warming of up to 0.2 degrees C per decade, and projections suggest that further widespread warming of 0.27 degrees to 1.08 degrees C will occur by the late 21st century. We assessed the potential influence of this projected warming on Antarctic krill habitat with a statistical model that links growth to temperature and chlorophyll concentration. The results divide the quadrant into two zones: a band around the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in which habitat quality is particularly vulnerable to warming, and a southern area which is relatively insensitive. Our analysis suggests that the direct effects of warming could reduce the area of growth habitat by up to 20\%. The reduction in growth habitat within the range of predators, such as Antarctic fur seals, that forage from breeding sites on South Georgia could be up to 55\%, and the habitat's ability to support Antarctic krill biomass production within this range could be reduced by up to 68\%. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the effects of a 50\% change in summer chlorophyll concentration could be more significant than the direct effects of warming. A reduction in primary production could lead to further habitat degradation but, even if chlorophyll increased by 50\%, projected warming would still cause some degradation of the habitat accessible to predators. While there is considerable uncertainty in these projections, they suggest that future climate change could have a significant negative effect on Antarctic krill growth habitat and, consequently, on Southern Ocean biodiversity and ecosystem services.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Hill, SL (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, Nat Environm Res Council, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

Using the data obtained during 14 shipboard surveys sampled on a fixed grid (150 K km(2)) during mid- to late summer, I quantified the spatial distribution and intra-seasonal variability of fur seal sightings relative to distance to land and hydrographic boundaries. I test the hypothesis that fur seals display an increase in their at-sea abundance during mid- to late summer near the Antarctic Peninsula as they prepare to take up wintering grounds. I also test whether abundances of their potential prey, krill and myctophids, exhibit intra-seasonal variability. During midsummer, high-abundance areas are located near major breeding colonies; however, during late summer, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in fur seal abundance, coinciding with an increase in the number of high-abundance areas located in Bransfield Strait. Coincidently, abundance of Euphausia superba decreased and the myctophid Electrona antarctica increased between mid- and late-summer surveys. High-abundance areas of fur seals are not associated with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front but are concentrated within 100 km from land, potentially indicating the location of haul out and important coastal habitat use areas. The dynamic increase in the number and location of high-abundance areas during late summer represents a considerable amount of mammalian predators entering the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. This information is important for understanding the seasonal impact of fur seals on regional marine food webs and their potential interaction with the autumn-winter krill fishery.","SPRINGER","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","English","Santora, JA (Corresponding Author), NOAA, Fisheries Ecol Div, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 110 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.

Sufficiently elevated CO2 concentrations can alter internal acid-base balance, compromising homeostatic regulation and disrupting internal systems ranging from oxygen transport to ion balance. We assessed feeding and nutrient excretion rates in natural populations of the keystone species Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) by conducting a CO2 perturbation experiment at ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 levels in January 2011 along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Under elevated CO2 conditions (similar to 672 ppm), ingestion rates of krill averaged 78 mu g C individual(-1) d(-1) and were 3.5 times higher than krill ingestion rates at ambient, present day CO2 concentrations. Additionally, rates of ammonium, phosphate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) excretion by krill were 1.5, 1.5, and 3.0 times higher, respectively, in the high CO2 treatment than at ambient CO2 concentrations. Excretion of urea, however, was similar to 17\% lower in the high CO2 treatment, suggesting differences in catabolic processes of krill between treatments. Activities of key metabolic enzymes, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), were consistently higher in the high CO2 treatment. The observed shifts in metabolism are consistent with increased physiological costs associated with regulating internal acid-base equilibria. This represents an additional stress that may hamper growth and reproduction, which would negatively impact an already declining krill population along the WAP.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Saba, GK (Corresponding Author), Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine \& Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.

While its food web is relatively intact, its oceanography, biogeochemistry, and sea ice coverage have been changing dramatically, and likely will continue to do so in the future. Sea ice cover and persistence have been increasing, in contrast to the Amundsen-Bellingshausen sector, which has resulted in reduced open water duration for its biota. Models predict that as the ozone hole recovers, ice cover will begin to diminish. Currents on the continental shelf will likely change in the coming century, with a projected intensification of flow leading to altered deep ocean ventilation. Such changes in ice and circulation will lead to altered plankton distributions and composition, but it is difficult at present to predict the nature of these changes. Iron and irradiance play central roles in regulating phytoplankton production in the Ross Sea, but the impacts of oceanographic changes on the biogeochemistry of iron are unclear. Unlike other Southern Ocean regions, where continental shelves are very narrow and Antarctic krill dominates the herbivorous fauna, the broad shelf of the Ross Sea is dominated by crystal krill and silverfish, which are the major prey items for higher trophic levels. At present, the Ross Sea is considered to be one of the most species-rich areas of the Southern Ocean and a biodiversity ``hotspot{''} due to its heterogeneous habitats. Despite being among the best-studied regions in the entire Southern Ocean, accurate predictions of the impacts of climate change on the oceanography and ecology of the Ross Sea remain fraught with uncertainty.","OCEANOGRAPHY SOC","P.O.

We present a population projection for the emperor penguin population of Terre Adelie, Antarctica, by linking demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of IPCC climate models. Based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (SICa) affect adult survival and breeding success. Demographic models show that both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized at intermediate values of annual SICa, because neither the complete absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. We show that under some conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the variance in SICa. We identify an ensemble of five general circulation climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea ice concentration in Terre Adelie. The output of this ensemble is used to produce stochastic forecasts of SICa, which in turn drive the population model. Uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error. The median of these simulations predicts a decline of the Terre Adelie emperor penguin population of 81\% by the year 2100. We find a 43\% chance of an even greater decline, of 90\% or more. The uncertainty in population projections reflects large differences among climate models in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. One such model predicts population increases over much of the century, but overall, the ensemble of models predicts that population declines are far more likely than population increases. We conclude that climate change is a significant risk for the emperor penguin. Our analytical approach, in which demographic models are linked to IPCC climate models, is powerful and generally applicable to other species and systems.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Jenouvrier, S (Corresponding Author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, MS-34, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.

We develop individual-based models of the state-dependent behavior of individual central place foragers over the course of a breeding season and show how our approach provides a framework for the prediction of trip lengths, foraging location, food delivery, and reproductive success. We formulate a common framework of models for northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus), black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), and thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), and provide worked examples parameterized to represent fur seals and murres. We then develop a game theoretic model at the colony-level for predicting the distribution of multiple individuals across space in the face of potential interference or facilitation, providing a worked example for kittiwakes. We demonstrate how these models can be used to predict near-term aspects of foraging behavior such as diet choice and trip destinations and durations at the individual and colony level. We show how (i) behavioral predictions can be translated into predictions of foraging success, (ii) foraging success can be scaled up to demographically relevant parameters such as survival and reproduction, and (iii) this approach can help predict impacts of environmental change on top-level predators.

The mesoscale habitat use of these birds is increasingly being quantified by relating their movements to remotely sensed, near surface properties of the ocean. However, prey availability at the sea surface may also be determined by habitat characteristics not measurable from space. For instance, benthic-pelagic coupling, which occurs when seabed processes affect productivity in the epipelagic zone, can link benthic habitat type to availability of surface prey. We combined acoustically derived maps of the substrate of the South Georgia shelf with GPS tracking to quantify the sub-mesoscale habitat use of breeding black-browed albatrosses. We show that albatrosses preferentially used waters overlaying glacial moraine banks near the shelf edge and that this was unrelated to the presence of trawlers targeting mackerel icefish, which are also associated with these features. Stomach temperature profiles suggest that albatrosses primarily caught krill and fish over the banks. We hypothesize that black-browed albatrosses target waters overlaying moraine banks due to upward benthic-pelagic coupling, mediated by an increase in abundance of zooplankton such as Antarctic krill. Our findings suggest that the potential effects of such processes on pelagic seabird distribution warrant wider investigation.","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","English","Wakefield, ED (Corresponding Author), Univ Leeds, Inst Integrat \& Comparat Biol, Manton Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.

These phase transitions are controlled by zooplankton in relation to their physical environment, through the selective accumulation of specific lipids with optimum levels of unsaturation. The necessity to control buoyancy and maintain an optimum depth is a fundamental evolutionary force, driving anatomical, biochemical and behavioural adaptations of all organisms within the aquatic realm. It is hypothesized that each species adjusts the amount, composition and anatomical location of lipids, to maximize fitness according to their preferred habitat and life history traits. Recent discoveries regarding the role of phase transitions of lipids in marine zooplankton and their role in regulating buoyancy will require re-interpretation of existing data and stimulate future scientific endeavours in zooplankton research.","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","English","Pond, DW (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

Attention has focused primarily on ecological concerns, whereas other environmental aspects, including potentially globally problematic emissions and material and energy demands, have not been examined in detail. Here we apply life cycle assessment to measure the contributions of krill meal, oil, and omega-3 capsules to global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, energy use, and biotic resource use. Supply chains of one krill fishing and processing company, Aker BioMarine of Norway, were assessed. Impacts of krill products were found to be driven primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels onboard the fishing vessel and a transport/resupply vessel. Approximately 190 L of fuel are burned per tonne of raw krill landed, markedly higher than fuel inputs to reduction fisheries targeting other species. In contrast, the biotic resource use associated with extracting krill is relatively low compared to that of other reduction fisheries. Results of this study provide insight into the broader environmental implications of the krill fishery, comparisons between products derived from krill and other species targeted for reduction, opportunities for improving the fishery's performance, and a baseline against which to measure future performance.","AMER CHEMICAL SOC","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","English","Parker, RWR (Corresponding Author), Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource \& Environm Studies, 6100 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.

For Antarctic pack-ice seals, an important group of krill predators, we estimate the density and krill consumption in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP)-Western Weddell Sea area, the main fishery region; and we consider long-term changes in suitable pack-ice habitat, increased fishing pressure and potential krill declines based upon predictions from declines in sea ice cover. More than 3 million crabeater seals consumed over 12 million tonnes of krill each year. This was approximately 17\% of the krill standing stock. The highest densities of pack ice seals where found in the WAP, including in its small-scale fishery management areas, where apparently suitable seal habitat has declined by 21-28\% over a 30 year period, where krill density is likely to have declined, and fishing has increased. The highest seal density was found in the Marguerite Bay area which is a source of krill for the Antarctic Peninsula and elsewhere. Significant sea-ice loss since 1979 has already occurred, leading to open water and possible expansion for the fishery in the future. These factors may combine to potentially reduce food for pack ice seals. Therefore, high uncertainty in krill and seal stock trends and in their environmental drivers call for a precautionary management of the krill fishery, in the absence of survey data to support management based on specific conservation objectives for pack-ice seals.

A key challenge is to understand how different activities over the year are linked. For instance, how does a change in spring activities, such as the timing or amount of egg production, influence autumn activities, for instance energy storage or migration? Trade-offs viewed in relation to individual lifetime fitness consequences couple these events. The framework of optimal annual routines provides theory and methodology for consistent analyses of these temporal trade-offs. Here I describe the key parts of optimal annual routine models and how the models can be used to: (i) study phenology, life-history strategies, and population dynamics; (ii) predict responses to environmental change; and (iii) guide future zooplankton studies. I mainly discuss the adaptations of zooplankton species inhabiting high latitude oceans where the seasonal cycle and its effects are particularly strong. Empirical challenges include issues of seasonal resolution, state-dependent processes and individual variability. Two ecological problems with avenues for future work are discussed in particular detail: the role of sea ice and ice algae in the life cycle of copepods and krill, and the adaptive value and ecological consequences of semelparous versus iteroparous reproductive strategies.","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","English","Varpe, O (Corresponding Author), Norwegian Polar Res Inst, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway.

We experimentally investigated the suitability of fatty acid trophic markers to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats. Eight groups of juvenile European eels were fed on eight different diets in a freshwater recirculation system at 20A degrees C for 56 days. Three groups were fed on freshwater diets (Rutilus rutilus, Chironomidae larvae, and Gammarus pulex) and four groups were reared on diets of a marine origin (Clupea harengus, Crangon crangon, Mysis spec., and Euphausia superba) and one on commercial pellets used in eel aquaculture. Fatty acid composition (FAC) of diets differed significantly with habitat. FAC of eel muscle tissue seemed to be rather insensitive to fatty acids supplied with diet, but the general pattern of lower n3:n6 and EPA:ARA ratios in freshwater prey organisms could be traced in the respective eels. Multivariate statistics of the fatty acid composition of the eels resulted in two distinct groups representing freshwater and marine treatments. Results further indicate the capability of selectively restraining certain fatty acids in eel, as e.g. the n3:n6 ratio in all treatments was < 4, regardless of dietary n3:n6. In future studies on wild eel, these measures can be used to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats of individual European eel.","SPRINGER","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","English","Prigge, E (Corresponding Author), IFM GEOMAR, Leibniz Inst Marine Sci, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.

Data were obtained using novel Surface and Under Ice Trawls (SUIT), which sampled the 0-2 m surface layer both under sea ice and in open water. Average surface layer densities ranged between 0.8 individuals m(-2) in summer and autumn, and 2.7 individuals m(-2) in winter. In summer, under-ice densities of Antarctic krill were significantly higher than in open waters. In autumn, the opposite pattern was observed. Under winter sea ice, densities were often low, but repeatedly far exceeded summer and autumn maxima. Statistical models showed that during summer high densities of Antarctic krill in the 0-2 m layer were associated with high ice coverage and shallow mixed layer depths, among other factors. In autumn and winter, density was related to hydrographical parameters. Average under-ice densities from the 0-2 m layer were higher than corresponding values from the 0-200 m layer collected with Rectangular Midwater Trawls (RMT) in summer. In winter, under-ice densities far surpassed maximum 0-200 m densities on several occasions. This indicates that the importance of the ice-water interface layer may be under-estimated by the pelagic nets and sonars commonly used to estimate the population size of Antarctic krill for management purposes, due to their limited ability to sample this habitat. Our results provide evidence for an almost year-round association of Antarctic krill with the under-ice habitat, hundreds of kilometres into the ice-covered area of the Lazarev Sea. Local concentrations of postlarval Antarctic krill under winter sea ice suggest that sea ice biota are important for their winter survival. These findings emphasise the susceptibility of an ecological key species to changing sea ice habitats, suggesting potential ramifications on Antarctic ecosystems induced by climate change.","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","English","Flores, H (Corresponding Author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar \& Marine Res AWI, Bremerhaven, Germany.

Biological rhythms are generated by biological clocks that time biological functions and are synchronized by geophysical cycles, such as the solar light-dark cycle and tidal cycle. On continental margins, behavioural rhythms can be detected by diel (i.e., 24-hour based) or seasonal periodical trawling as a consequence of massive inward and outward displacements of populations to and from the sample areas. As a result, significant errors in population/stock and biodiversity assessments performed by trawling may occur if timing of sampling is not taken into account. The increasing number of cabled and permanent multiparametric seafloor observatories now allows direct, continuous, and long-lasting monitoring of benthic ecosystems and analysis in relation to several habitat cycles. This review describes the adaptation of this technology to investigations of rhythmic behaviour by focussing on automated video imaging. Did l fluctuations in the number of video-observed individuals can be used as a measure of average population rhythmic behaviour. The potential implementation of automated video image analysis in relation to animal tracking and classification procedures based on the combined use of morphometric tools and multivariate statistics is detailed in relation to populational and community studies. Based on video cameras mounted at multiparametric cabled observatories, an integrated time-series analysis protocol using chronobiomedical procedures is proposed to place video-recorded bioinformation in an oceanographic context.","CRC PRESS-TAYLOR \& FRANCIS GROUP","6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA","English","Aguzzi, J (Corresponding Author), Inst Ciencias Mar ICM CSIC, Paseo Maritimo de la Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.

They are particularly useful for identifying gaps and inconsistencies in the data, and for exploring plausible scenarios of change. We compiled data on the pelagic foodweb of the South Georgia shelf, which is one of the most intensively studied areas in the Southern Ocean. The data suggest that current average annual copepod production is three times that of Antarctic krill and that flying seabirds and fish are, respectively, responsible for 25\% and 21\% of local krill consumption. The most striking inconsistency was that estimated consumption of fish was 5 times their estimated production. We developed a static mass balance model of the foodweb representing one of many possible solutions to the inconsistencies in the data. The model included sufficient fish biomass to balance the original consumption estimate, and consequently fish became the main krill consumers. Nonetheless, only 74\% of local krill production was consumed by predators, suggesting that there are additional mortality sources that we did not explicitly model. We developed further models to explore scenarios incorporating plausible climate-driven reductions in krill biomass. In scenarios with unchanged predator diets, an 80\% reduction in krill biomass resulted in a 73\% reduction in vertebrate biomass. However, when predators with diverse diets were able to switch to feeding on alternative zooplankton prey, total vertebrate biomass was maintained at current levels. Scenarios in which 80\% of krill biomass was replaced with copepod biomass required 28\% more primary production because the estimated consumption rate of copepods is higher than that of krill. The additional copepod biomass did not alter the consequences for vertebrates. These scenarios illustrate the wide range of potential consequences of a shift from a krill to a copepod dominated system in a warming climate. They suggest that both maintenance and dramatic reduction of vertebrate production are plausible outcomes, although the former requires major changes in predator diets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Beginning with R. C. Murphy (Pacific), V. C. Wynne-Edwards (Atlantic), and associates in the early 1900s, the research approach grew from an emphasis on seabird single-species ecology to an appreciation of interacting species assemblages and finally to seabirds being considered as important components of marine food webs. After a slow, drawn-out beginning, the initial main impetus for developing the field was a need to map seabird abundance and distribution tied to understanding impacts of continental shelf resource exploitation. Coalescing during the 1970s to 1980s to facilitate this line of research were 6 factors: (1) ability to identify birds at sea; (2) standardization of techniques to quantify abundance; (3) resources and techniques for mapping; (4) appreciation of how scale affects seabird relationships to hydrographic features and patchy prey; (5) development of computing power and appropriate statistics; and (6) seabird biologists becoming embedded in, as well as organizing, multidisciplinary marine research projects. Future advances in understanding the role of seabirds in marine food webs will be made by seabird biologists participating in multidisciplinary projects using grid-like surveys relative to oceanographic features in combination with instrumentation that reveals the finer details of seabird foraging behaviors.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Ainley, DG (Corresponding Author), HT Harvey \& Associates, 983 Univ Ave, Los Gatos, CA 95032 USA.

Each species relies primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and has physiological constraints and foraging behaviors that dictate their ecological niches. Understanding the degree of ecological overlap between sympatric krill predators is critical to understanding and predicting the impacts on climate-driven changes to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. To explore ecological relationships amongst sympatric krill predators, we developed ecological niche models using a maximum entropy modeling approach (Maxent) that allows the integration of data collected by a variety of means (e.g. satellite-based locations and visual observations). We created spatially explicit probability distributions for the four krill predators in fall 2001 and 2002 in conjunction with a suite of environmental variables. We find areas within Marguerite Bay with high krill predator occurrence rates or biological hot spots. We find the modeled ecological niches for Adelie penguins and crabeater seals may be affected by their physiological needs to haul-out on substrate. Thus, their distributions may be less dictated by proximity to prey and more so by physical features that over time provide adequate access to prey. Humpback and minke whales, being fully marine and having greater energetic demands, occupy ecological niches more directly proximate to prey. We also find evidence to suggest that the amount of overlap between modeled niches is relatively low, even for species with similar energetic requirements. In a rapidly changing and variable environment, our modeling work shows little indication that krill predators maintain similar ecological niches across years around Marguerite Bay. Given the amount of variability in the marine environment around the Antarctic Peninsula and how this affects the local abundance of prey, there may be consequences for krill predators with historically little niche overlap to increase the potential for interspecific competition for shared prey resources.

Recently evidence emerged that free-drifting icebergs were hotspots of biogeochemical and ecological activity. They also represent physical habitat structure both above and below the sea surface. Here we found seabird abundances that were 2 to 6 times greater within about one-half km of free drifting icebergs than the area between about one-half and one km from the iceberg edge. Aggregation was measured by surveys with an experimental design for determining potential local impacts of free-drifting icebergs on seabird density. Seabird surveys were conducted during three cruises in the Weddell Sea from 4 to 20 December 2005, 11 to 25 June 2008, and 21 March to 2 April 2009. Visual surveys were done on the vessel bridge typically for periods of five minutes facing the port or starboard side. Differences in species composition were also linked to distance from the iceberg edge for the most sampled icebergs with Daption capense exhibiting change in relative abundance. On a local scale, environmental factors such as surface productivity, air temperature, and winds were not consistently related to seabird distributions and community dynamics. The results suggest that climatically-driven variations in iceberg abundance would influence local seabird distributions with unknown impacts on regional abundances and species composition.

This pattern implies high potential for differentiation in benthic shelf species with limited dispersal, yet consequences for pelagic organisms are less clear. The present study investigates levels of genetic variation and population structure of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba using mitochondrial DNA and EST-linked microsatellite markers for an unprecedentedly comprehensive sampling of its populations over a circum-Antarctic range. Results: MtDNA (ND1) sequences and EST-linked microsatellite markers indicated no clear sign of genetic structure among populations over large geographic scales, despite considerable power to detect differences inferred from forward-time simulations. Based on ND1, few instances of genetic heterogeneity, not significant after correction for multiple tests, were detected between geographic or temporal samples. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution based on mtDNA sequences revealed strong evidence of past population expansion. Significant positive values of the parameter g (a measure of population growth) were obtained from microsatellite markers using a coalescent-based genealogical method and suggested a recent start (60 000 - 40 000 years ago) for the expansion. Conclusions: The results provide evidence of lack of genetic heterogeneity of Antarctic krill at large geographic scales and unequivocal support for recent population expansion. Lack of genetic structuring likely reflects the tight link between krill and circum-Antarctic ocean currents and is consistent with the hypothesis that differentiation processes in Antarctic species are largely influenced by dispersal potential, whereas small-scale spatial and temporal differentiation might be due to local conditions leading to genetic patchiness. The signal of recent population growth suggests differential impact of glacial cycles on pelagic Antarctic species, which experienced population expansion during glaciations with increased available habitat, versus sedentary benthic shelf species. EST-linked microsatellites provide new perspectives to complement the results based on mtDNA and suggest that data-mining of EST libraries will be a useful approach to facilitate use of microsatellites for additional species.","BIOMED CENTRAL LTD","236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","English","Zane, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Via U Bassi 58B, I-35121 Padua, Italy.

There has been limited direct assessment of these interactions through deployment of cameras on commercial fishing gear especially on demersal longlines. A compact, autonomous deep-sea video system was designed and constructed by the Australian Antarctic Division (MD) for deployment on commercial fishing gear to observe interactions with benthos in the Southern Ocean finfish fisheries (targeting toothfish, Dissostichus spp). The Benthic Impacts Camera System (BICS) is capable of withstanding depths to 2500 m, has been successfully fitted to both longline and demersal trawl fishing gear, and is suitable for routine deployment by non-experts such as fisheries observers or crew. The system is entirely autonomous, robust, compact, easy to operate, and has minimal effect on the performance of the fishing gear it is attached to. To date, the system has successfully captured footage that demonstrates the interactions between demersal fishing gear and the benthos during routine commercial operations. It provides the first footage demonstrating the nature of the interaction between demersal longlines and benthic habitats in the Southern Ocean, as well as showing potential as a tool for rapidly assessing habitat types and presence of mobile biota such as krill (Euphausia superba).

We suggest that industries with the greatest potential to aggravate climate change impacts on marine communities are marine capture fisheries. In the Southern Ocean, harvesting is governed under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). CCAMLR espouses an ecological management framework and so has the capacity to mitigate harvesting impacts such that they do not worsen impacts from climate change. We discuss some of the implications of climate change and advocate that CCAMLR address certain key issues if it is to fulfil its international obligations. It will be essential for CCAMLR to determine relative risks (uncertainties), impacts and timescales, of various processes consequent on climate change. Such risk assessments should be feasible with current knowledge and should provide a focus for future work. We believe it will be important to prioritize issues that reduce impacts and uncertainties by the greatest degree, and propose that future plans should involve shared responsibility (e.g. with SCAR etc.) for each of the risks described.","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","English","Trathan, PN (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

During the breeding period, proximity to suitable feeding sites is essential for central place foragers, whereas during the non-breeding period their distribution is relatively unconstrained. We combined light-based geolocation and satellite tracking to investigate seasonal variation in foraging grounds and behaviour of white-chinned petrels from Kerguelen Island. Birds were associated with highly productive areas throughout the year. During breeding (summer), they performed long commuting trips from the colony to distant, productive Antarctic waters. Thereafter, birds migrated 5200 km westwards to the Benguela upwelling system off Namibia and South Africa to spend the winter. This seasonal shift of foraging grounds coincides with a change in activity patterns; much less time was spent in flight in winter than in summer. Individual variability in the locations of foraging zones and seasonal/daily activity patterns was low. Trip durations were shorter during chick-rearing than incubation, although birds often travelled as far or farther, tracking the gradual break up of pack ice. Habitat use models revealed an association with distance to sea-ice edge and chlorophyll a gradient during incubation, whereas sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a gradient best explained habitat use during chick rearing. White-chinned petrels are likely to overlap with other marine predators and fisheries throughout the year. Fishery bycatch constitutes the most significant direct threat to petrels at sea. Moreover, future climate-induced reductions in productivity could affect birds year-round.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Peron, C (Corresponding Author), CNRS, UPR 1934, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79369 Villiers En Bois, France.

The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Watkins, JL (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

Here, we present a chronology of temporally fine-scale data on the trophic niche of otariid seals by measuring the isotopic signature of serially sampled whiskers. Whiskers of male Antarctic fur seals breeding at the Crozet Islands showed synchronous and regular oscillations in both their delta(13)C and delta(15)N values that are likely to represent their annual migrations over the long term (mean 4.8 years). At the population level, male Antarctic fur seals showed substantial variation in both delta(13)C and delta(15)N values, occupying nearly all the `isotopic space' created by the diversity of potential oceanic habitats (from high Antarctica to the subtropics) and prey (from Antarctic krill to sub-antarctic and subtropical mesopelagic fishes). At the individual level, whisker isotopic signatures depict a large diversity of foraging strategies. Some seals remained in either subantarctic or Antarctic waters, while the migratory cycle of most animals encompassed a wide latitudinal gradient where they fed on different prey. The isotopic signature of whiskers, therefore, revealed new multi-year foraging strategies of male Antarctic fur seals and is a powerful tool for investigating the ecological niche during cryptic stages of mammals' life.","ROYAL SOC","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","English","Cherel, Y (Corresponding Author), CNRS, UPR 1934, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.

Standardized strip-transect surveys were used to map seabirds, and a combination of acoustic and net surveys was used to map krill. We measured patch size of krill and seabirds and elucidated how krill patch dynamics influence foraging seabirds. The spatial association between krill and predators was influenced by the size and arrangement of krill patches. We found a negative relationship between abundance and patchiness of krill and predators, indicating that when krill is less abundant, its predators are less abundant and concentrated. We conclude that annual patch dynamics of krill strongly influences the local abundance and distribution of seabirds.

In addition, assessments of change in this region are hampered by the strong seasonal bias in sampling, with the vast majority of data collected during the austral summer. However, oceanographic measurements near South Georgia span most of the last century, and we here consider almost year-round data from this location over an 81-year period (1925-2006). We observe significant warming between the early and late 20th century, with differential warming between summer and winter months and an indication that late 20th century summer temperatures peaked similar to 6 days earlier. To quantify the long-term warming trend in this highly variable data, a mixed model utilising a Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) method was used. Over the 81-year period, a mean increase of similar to 0.9 degrees C in January and similar to 2.3 degrees C in August was evident in the top 100 m of the water column. Warming diminished below 100 m and approached 0 at 200 m. Thus the long-term warming around South Georgia is substantial-more so than documented previously for the circumpolar warming of the Southern Ocean. We examine potential causal effects of this trend, including local atmospheric and cryospheric change, the influence of upstream waters and the role of coupled modes of climate variability such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). It is likely that all of these play a part in the observed temperature increase. However, the role of the SAM is strongly indicated, via its likely role in the circumpolar warming trend in the Southern Ocean, and also by the atypical response of the South Georgia region to changes in heat fluxes associated with the SAM. Furthermore. the combination of a regional decline in ice extent and strong upstream warming likely explains a significant part of the strong seasonal variation apparent in the warming trend. In addition, we consider the implications that long-term warming has for South Georgia's lower trophic levels. For Euphausia superba, at their northern limit, we find a significant negative relationship between summer South Georgia water temperatures and mean summer density of E superba across the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Simple abundance and growth rate relationships with our long-term temperature data appear to show declining habitat suitability for E superba. In contrast, the warming trend is likely to favour other macro- and mesozooplankton species that occupy the more northerly parts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and it is likely to promote phytoplankton growth.

The evaluation of their inter-annual variability in the context of ice dynamics and trends in regional climate has not been possible. During the late winters of 2001 (July-August) and 2002 (August-September) we assessed sea-ice dynamics, sea-ice characteristics, and biomass of sea-ice microbiota along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. These two winters were marked by large contrasts in the dates of initial ice formation (late June in 2001 and April in 2002), which resulted in differences in the physical pack-ice characteristics. Chlorophyll a (chl a) content in ice cores differed between the study years, with 2002 having 10-fold higher chl a content. The difference in ice-core chl a content is best explained by the timing of ice formation that leads to less phytoplankton scavenging from the water column and a lack of transfer of solar energy into the pack-ice ecosystem. Such a tractable atmosphere ocean-ice-biota coupling may help in evaluating underlying processes responsible for long-term trends in recruitment cycles of upper trophic levels as well as future projections on the response of the Antarctic marine ecosystems to variability in local climate.

Given the spatial overlap in the distribution of these krill predators (particularly humpback whales) and their dependence on krill, the goals of this paper are to determine if the inter-annual community structure and relative abundance of baleen whales around Anvers Island is related to krill demography and abundance, and if the potential exists for inter-specific interactions between Adelie penguins and baleen. We use whale sightings and prey data from both net tows and Adelie penguin stomach samples to correlate the abundance of humpback whales with krill demography and abundance from 1993 to 2001. We find significant relationships between whale abundance and the size-frequency distribution of krill targeted by Adelie penguins, as well as the foraging success of Adelie penguins. These findings suggest both krill predators share common prey preferences in the upper portions of the water column around Anvers Island. These findings highlight the need for better knowledge of baleen whale foraging ecology and inter-specific interactions with penguins, as sea ice and krill populations around the Antarctic Peninsula are affected by rapid changes in climate.","SPRINGER","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","English","Friedlaender, AS (Corresponding Author), Duke Univ, Marine Lab, 135 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.

We projected growth trajectories for individual krill within cohorts and estimated how total biomass in an area available to both predators and the fishery may vary from year to year simply due to fluctuations in temperature. We used an existing temperature-dependent growth model and a time series of temperature data (1970 to 2004) for 2 regions in the Southern Ocean: (1) around the Antarctic Peninsula, and (2) around the island of South Georgia. The growth model predicted increasing individual size within a cohort (in terms of length and weight) with increasing temperature in the cooler Antarctic Peninsula region and decreasing individual size with increasing temperature in the warmer South Georgia region. Years with many cohorts of small individuals in the population resulted in biomass well below average, whereas years with many cohorts of large individuals resulted in biomass well above the average, suggesting that temporal changes in Southern Ocean temperatures may have profound effects on the total biomass in an area that is available to both predators and the fishery. Moreover, the effects of a potentially warming Southern Ocean on krill biomass will likely be more pronounced in the warmer regions occupied by krill.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Wiedenmann, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ocean Sci, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.

The second deals with the importance of various types of lipids during reproduction, development, and resting phases and addresses the role of the different storage lipids during growth and dormancy. The third relates to trophic marker lipids, which are an important tool to follow lipid and energy transfer through the food web. The central question is how can fatty acids be used to identify and quantify food web relationships? With the fourth, hypotheses are presented on effects of global warming, which may result in the reduction or change in abundance of large, lipid-rich copepods in polar oceans, thereby strongly affecting higher trophic levels.

Moving from correlations with environmental parameters to an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to these correlations may allow predictions of the consequences of climate change on the distribution of favourable habitat for Antarctic krill. During winter cruises in 2001 and 2002 in the region west of the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the most rapidly warming regions on the planet, ice camps were established for periods of 3-9 days. Timing of sea ice advance, chlorophyll a concentrations in ice cores, and growth rates and pigment content of larval krill all differed significantly between winters. Growth rates and pigment content of larval krill from the same ice floe were correlated, suggesting that growth rates in winter are a function of the biomass of the sea ice microbial community. A possible mechanism underlying the correlation between recruitment success and timing of ice advance is proposed. In conjunction with other postulated habitat requirements, this proposed mechanism allows for speculation about future changes in the geographic location of favourable habitat for Antarctic krill.","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","English","Quetin, LB (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.

These birds have large olfactory bulbs, and the use of smell has been implicated in both foraging and homing behavior. While many olfactory cues relevant to these behaviors have been identified, ammonia is a potentially significant, biogenic, scented compound that has not been studied in this context. Ammonium (NH4+) constitutes a primary waste product produced by many of the prey species on which procellariiforms forage. Nitrogen waste products, including volatilized ammonia (NH3) also scent the terrestrial landscape of sub-Antarctic islands where newly breeding procellariiform seabirds recruit and raise their young. Since an ability to smell ammonia may be relevant to both prey detection and locating colonies or islands, we used a non-invasive, behavioral assay to examine whether this scented compound is detectable by a candidate test species, the blue petrel Halobaena caerulea Gmelin. Our results suggest that these birds can detect volatilized ammonia within a concentration range that they may naturally encounter (10(-11) to 10(-5) M), and point to ammonia as a potential signal molecule in the sub-Antarctic.","INTER-RESEARCH","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","English","Nevitt, GA (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Anim Behav, Sect Neurobiol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.

These behaviors are driven by interactions within and between species, environmental conditions, and the biology of the species involved. Although extensive theoretical work has explored predator-prey dynamics, these models have not considered the impact of behavioral plasticity and life-history trade-offs on predicted patterns. We apply a modeling method that allows the consideration of a spatial, dynamic ecological game between predators and prey using a life-history perspective. As an illustrative example, we model the habitat selection of Antarctic krill- and penguins during the time when penguins are land-based for reproduction. Although environmental conditions and the life-history constraints of each species have both direct and indirect effects on both species, the penguin's foraging rule (whether food-maximizing or time-minimizing) has the greatest effect on the qualitative distribution pattern of both species. Size-dependent-diel vertical migration of krill also strongly affects penguin foraging patterns. This model generates suggestions for future research and qualitative predictions that can be tested in the field. The application of this method to a specific problem also demonstrates its ability to increase our understanding of important ecological interactions in general.","WILEY","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","English","Alonzo, SH (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.

In order to investigate this, we analysed data on krill-eating predators at South Georgia from 1980 to 2000. Indices of population size and reproductive performance showed declines in all species and an increase in the frequency of years of low reproductive output. Changes in the population structure of krill and its relationship with reproductive performance suggested that the biomass of krill within the largest size class was sufficient to support predator demand in the 1980s but not in the 1990s. We suggest that the effects of underlying changes in the system on the krill population structure have been amplified by predator-induced mortality, resulting in breeding predators now regularly operating close to the limit of krill availability. Understanding how krill demography is affected by changes in physical environmental factors and by predator consumption and how, in turn, this influences predator performance and survival, is one of the keys to predicting future change in Antarctic marine ecosystems.","ROYAL SOC","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","English","Reid, K (Corresponding Author), British Antarctic Survey, NERC, High Cross,Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England.

Research efforts to evaluate the impact of this phenomenon have focused on phytoplankton under the assumption that ecosystem effects will most likely originate through reductions in primary productivity; however, phytoplankton do not represent the only significant component in ecosystem response to elevated UVB. Antarctic bacterioplankton are adversely affected by UVB exposure; and invertebrates and fish, particularly early developmental stages that reside in the plankton, are sensitive to UVB. There is little Information available on UV responses of larger Antarctic marine animals (e.g., birds, seals and whales). Understanding the balance between direct biological damage and species-specific potentials for UV tolerance (protection and recovery) relative to trophic dynamics and biogeochemical cycling is a crucial factor in evaluating the overall impact of ozone depletion. After more than a decade of research, much Information has been gathered about UV-photobiology in Antarctica; however, a definitive quantitative assessment of the effect of ozone depletion on the Antarctic ecosystem still eludes us. It is only obvious that ozone depletion has not had a catastrophic effect in the Antarctic region.

Therefore, we review some examples of exploited fishery stocks in which environmental control is a major contributor to structuring the abundance and distribution of the stock. Four examples, taken from studies of northern cod (Gadus morhua), cod and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) larvae, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), are given that clearly illustrate environmental control on the fishery. From these examples, we argue that future management strategies for exploited fisheries must include effects of environmental variability. In particular, management strategies must be flexible enough to include delayed responses to environmental variations that result from the transfer of perturbations from larger to smaller scales and vice versa. This capability requires an understanding of where linkages between the physical environment and the species of interest occur. Development of this knowledge requires input from a variety of disciplines, coordinated research programs, and considerable cooperation at national and international levels.","ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER","2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","English","Hofmann, EE (Corresponding Author), Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.

"151","Devi","No","article","SINIFF, DB","AN OVERVIEW OF THE ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC SEALS","AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST","1991","31",NA,"Four species of seals occupy the pack-ice region of the oceans surrounding the Antarctic Continent.  These seals include the crabeater (Lobodon carcinophagus), Leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx), weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii), and ross and are true seals with special adaptations for living in the pack-ice region.  Two other seal species, the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) and the fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) (the only eared seal of this region) generally occur further to the north and use land rather than ice during the period of birth of young.  This paper reviews the status of these species, and examines the general ecology of the four species that inhabit the pack-ice zone.  In general, the four species that occupy the pack-ice zone have specialized in habitats and habits so that little overlap in diets or habitat use exist among these species.  The exception is the interaction between the leopard and the crabeater which occupy the same regions and eat krill (Euphausia superba), particularly during the winter.  The impact of the potential harvest of krill by man on these species is discussed.  Further, the impact that recovery of the large baleen whales that feed in this region during the summer is discussed with regard to the changes that might occur as competition for krill by the large vertebrate species increases.","AMER SOC ZOOLOGISTS","1041 NEW HAMPSHIRE ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044","English","SINIFF, DB (Corresponding Author), UNIV MINNESOTA,DEPT ECOL EVOLUT \& BEHAV,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455, USA.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"LEPTONYCHOTES-WEDDELLI; LOBODON-CARCINOPHAGUS; CRABEATER SEALS; SOUTH GEORGIA; ARCTOCEPHALUS","Zoology","Zoology",NA,NA,NA,NA,"25","37","8","98","Am.
