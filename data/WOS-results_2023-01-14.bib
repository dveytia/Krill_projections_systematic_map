Title = {The energetic cost of early reproductive development in juvenile
   Antarctic krill at the Western Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {The overwinter survival mechanisms of Antarctic krill, Euphausia
   superba, are poorly characterized, especially for juveniles. It has been
   suggested that juveniles adopt a mix of strategies characteristic of
   both larvae and adults. Like larvae, they may feed opportunistically
   throughout winter when food is available, and like adults they may be
   able to suppress their metabolism when food is scarce. In this study we
   look at the overwinter strategies of juvenile krill and how their
   reproductive development changes when energy input exceeds what is
   necessary for survival. We take a closer look at how the sexual
   maturation of juvenile krill progresses in response to different
   environmental conditions throughout the fall and winter. We exposed
   juvenile Antarctic krill to four different ``food environment
   scenarios{''}, supplementing them with various diets from May to
   September 2019 that were representative of environmental conditions that
   they may encounter in different regions of the Western Antarctic
   Peninsula during autumn and winter. Each month, we measured the
   physiology and condition of the krill, and assessed the reproductive
   development of females. We found that when female juvenile krill have
   greater energy reserves than what is needed to survive the winter, they
   will begin to sexually mature. Further, when there are sufficient levels
   of the fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid
   (DHA) and 16:4 (n-1), krill are likely to be in a more reproductive
   advanced stage. However, when lipids, EPA, DHA and 16:4 (n-1) are
   depleted throughout the winter, juvenile female krill lose their ability
   to develop reproductively. We also found that sexual development is an
   energy intensive process that requires high respiration rates in
   juvenile krill. Furthermore, when juvenile females expend energy
   maturing, their physiological condition declines. This trade-off between
   early reproductive development and condition in juvenile female krill
   has important implications for individual health and population
   fecundity. Gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms behind
   juvenile krill winter survival strategies and their consequences will
   allow us to predict how future change at the western Antarctic Peninsula
   may affect krill population dynamics, especially in light of a warming
   climate.},

Abstract = {The study aimed to investigate krill (Euphausia superba) and salp (Salpa
   thompsoni) populations in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean in
   January and February 2022. Samples were obtained to measure the
   abundance, biomass and distribution patterns of krill and salp. Sex
   differences and feeding habits of the Antarctic krill were determined.
   The dependence of the physiological state of the studied aquatic
   organisms on changes in environmental parameters was analyzed. Current
   data on the association of the dynamics of hydrometeorological
   parameters and processes with the distribution of chlorophyll a, krill,
   and salp were obtained. It was established that, at numerous stations,
   the biomass of salps prevailed over krill. The result indicates the
   replacement of the Antarctic krill populations by gelatinous
   zooplankton. The obtained results allow assessment of the biological
   resource potential in the studied region based on the analysis of the

Title = {The Role of Zooplankton Grazing and Nutrient Recycling for Global Ocean
   Biogeochemistry and Phytoplankton Phenology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Zooplankton plays a notable role in ocean biogeochemical cycles.
   However, it is often simulated as one generic group and top closure term
   in ocean biogeochemical models. This study presents the description of
   three zooplankton functional types (zPFTs, micro-, meso- and
   macrozooplankton) in the ocean biogeochemical model FESOM-REcoM. In the
   presented model, microzooplankton is a fast-growing herbivore group,
   mesozooplankton is another major consumer of phytoplankton, and
   macrozooplankton is a slow-growing group with a low temperature optimum.
   Meso- and macrozooplankton produce fast-sinking fecal pellets. With
   three zPFTs, the annual mean zooplankton biomass increases threefold to
   210 Tg C. The new food web structure leads to a 25\% increase in net
   primary production and a 10\% decrease in export production globally.
   Consequently, the export ratio decreases from 17\% to 12\% in the model.
   The description of three zPFTs reduces model mismatches with observed
   dissolved inorganic nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations in the South
   Pacific and the Arctic Ocean, respectively. Representation of three
   zPFTs also strongly affects phytoplankton phenology: Fast nutrient
   recycling by zooplankton sustains higher chlorophyll concentrations in
   summer and autumn. Additional zooplankton grazing delays the start of
   the phytoplankton bloom by 3 weeks and controls the magnitude of the
   bloom peak in the Southern Ocean. As a result, the system switches from
   a light-controlled Sverdrup system to a dilution-controlled Behrenfeld
   system. Overall, the results suggest that representation of multiple
   zPFTs is important to capture underlying processes that may shape the
   response of ecosystems and ecosystem services to on-going and future
   environmental change in model projections.},

Title = {Winter condition, physiology, and growth potential of juvenile Antarctic
   krill},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to understand the
   implications of climate change on Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba,
   because of their pivotal role in the Southern Ocean food web and in
   biogeochemical cycling. Winter is one of the least studied seasons in
   Antarctica and we have limited understanding about the strategies
   Antarctic krill use to survive the winter. In particular, data on the
   winter physiology and condition of juvenile Antarctic krill are severely
   lacking. From May to September (the austral autumn-winter) of 2019, we
   maintained juvenile Antarctic krill in large (1,330 L) aquarium tanks at
   Palmer Station, Antarctica and, at monthly time intervals, measured
   their physiology and condition. Each tank served as a ``food environment
   scenario{''}, representing possible food environments the krill may
   encounter during winter along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. We found
   that, unlike adults, juvenile krill maintain relatively high respiration
   rates through the winter and respond positively to increased food
   concentrations by increasing their ingestion rates. Unlike larval krill,
   juveniles use lipid stores accumulated during the summer and autumn to
   sustain themselves through periods of starvation in the winter. We used
   our empirically derived measurements of physiology and condition to
   estimate the energy budget and growth potential of juvenile krill during
   the winter. We found that, given their comparatively high respiration
   rates, small juvenile krill (20 mg dry weight) would need to encounter
   food at concentrations of similar to 0.15 mg C L-1 daily to avoid loss
   of body carbon. Without sufficient lipid reserves, this value increases
   to similar to 0.54 mg C L-1, daily. The health of juvenile krill in the
   wintertime is dependent on their ability to accumulate lipid stores in
   the summer and autumn and to find sufficient food during the winter.
   Changes in food availability to Antarctic krill throughout the year may
   become problematic to juvenile krill in the future. Understanding the
   variability in the winter energy budget of juvenile Antarctic krill will
   allow us to improve population models that make assumptions on seasonal
   growth patterns.},

Title = {Climate drivers of Southern Ocean phytoplankton community composition
   and potential impacts on higher trophic levels},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Southern Ocean phytoplankton production supports rich Antarctic marine
   ecosystems comprising copepods, krill, fish, seals, penguins, and
   whales. Anthropogenic climate change, however, is likely to drive
   rearrangements in phytoplankton community composition with potential
   ramifications for the whole ecosystem. In general, phytoplankton
   communities dominated by large phytoplankton, i.e., diatoms, yield
   shorter, more efficient food chains than ecosystems supported by small
   phytoplankton. Guided by a large ensemble of Earth system model
   simulations run under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5), we present
   hypotheses for how anthropogenic climate change may drive shifts in
   phytoplankton community structure in two regions of the Southern Ocean:
   the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) region and the sea ice zone
   (SIZ). Though both Southern Ocean regions experience warmer ocean
   temperatures and increased advective iron flux under 21st century
   climate warming, the model simulates a proliferation of diatoms at the
   expense of small phytoplankton in the ACC, while the opposite patterns
   are evident in the SIZ. The primary drivers of simulated diatom
   increases in the ACC region include warming, increased iron supply, and
   reduced light from increased cloudiness. In contrast, simulated
   reductions in ice cover yield greater light penetration in the SIZ,
   generating a phenological advance in the bloom accompanied by a shift to
   more small phytoplankton that effectively consume available iron; the
   result is an overall increase in net primary production, but a
   decreasing proportion of diatoms. Changes of this nature may promote
   more efficient trophic energy transfer via copepods or krill in the ACC
   region, while ecosystem transfer efficiency in the SIZ may decline as
   small phytoplankton grow in dominance, possibly impacting marine food
   webs sustaining Antarctic marine predators. Despite the simplistic
   ecosystem representation in our model, our results point to a potential
   shift in the relative success of contrasting phytoplankton ecological
   strategies in different regions of the Southern Ocean, with
   ramifications for higher trophic levels.},

Title = {Predicted changes in the distribution of Antarctic krill in the
   Cosmonaut Sea under future climate change scenarios},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are the key species of the
   ecological system in the Cosmonaut Sea. Long-term habitat alterations in
   krill due to climate change have been considered in recent decades.
   However, there is still a lack understanding about krill distribution.
   The MaxEnt model was used to forecast the suitable distribution area of
   krill for this study, which is based on data from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project in its sixth phase (CMIP6) in the near future
   and far future. A total of 145 occurrence points and 15 environmental
   factors were selected to build the MaxEnt model. The current suitable
   habitat regions for krill were mostly detected in the western and
   central regions of the Cosmonaut Sea, which accounted for 10.07\% of the
   total area. The most important environmental variables that influenced
   krill distribution were minimum surface solar radiation downward
   (ssrdmin), the mean temperature (tem) and the mean northward velocity
   (v). In the near future and far future, the suitable area of krill was
   seen to decline under all shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), with the
   smallest reduction under SSP1-2.6 and the greatest reduction under
   SSP5-8.5. The suitable area for krill dropped quicker from the near
   future to the far future than the present to the near future. Krill
   habitats were expected to shift to the poles. The tem continued to rise
   in the future under all SSP scenarios, particularly under the high
   radiative forcing scenario. The increase in water temperature is the
   main reason for the decrease in suitable areas for Antarctic krill. Our
   results show the future distribution of krill in the future and provide
   a reasonable reference for the ecological protection policy of the
   Cosmonaut Sea.},

Title = {Status, Change, and Futures of Zooplankton in the Southern Ocean},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {In the Southern Ocean, several zooplankton taxonomic groups,
   euphausiids, copepods, salps and pteropods, are notable because of their
   biomass and abundance and their roles in maintaining food webs and
   ecosystem structure and function, including the provision of globally
   important ecosystem services. These groups are consumers of microbes,
   primary and secondary producers, and are prey for fishes, cephalopods,
   seabirds, and marine mammals. In providing the link between microbes,
   primary production, and higher trophic levels these taxa influence
   energy flows, biological production and biomass, biogeochemical cycles,
   carbon flux and food web interactions thereby modulating the structure
   and functioning of ecosystems. Additionally, Antarctic krill (Euphausia
   superba) and various fish species are harvested by international
   fisheries. Global and local drivers of change are expected to affect the
   dynamics of key zooplankton species, which may have potentially profound
   and wide-ranging implications for Southern Ocean ecosystems and the
   services they provide. Here we assess the current understanding of the
   dominant metazoan zooplankton within the Southern Ocean, including
   Antarctic krill and other key euphausiid, copepod, salp and pteropod
   species. We provide a systematic overview of observed and potential
   future responses of these taxa to a changing Southern Ocean and the
   functional relationships by which drivers may impact them. To support
   future ecosystem assessments and conservation and management strategies,
   we also identify priorities for Southern Ocean zooplankton research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {101},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study examines the adaptability of a Southern Ocean predator, which
   is dependent on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), to potential
   changes in food availability. Muscle fatty acids (FAs) of the spiny
   icefish Chaenodraco wilsoni collected from three areas in the Bransfield
   Strait (BS), northern Antarctic Peninsula during February-April 2016
   give a good representation of their feeding variability. The
   compositions of 22:6n3 (DHA) and 20:5n3 (EPA) were both higher in the
   Transitional Zonal Water with Bellingshausen influence (TBW)-controlled
   C. wilsoni than in the Transitional Zonal Water with Weddell Sea
   influence (TWW)-controlled fish. This was positively correlated with
   photoadaptation and carbon sequestration in TBW-controlled
   phytoplankton. Results for the FAs 16:1n7, 16:0, DHA and EPA indicate
   the presence of dinoflagellates in all three areas, suggesting that
   during late summer and early fall, there is a seasonal phytoplankton
   succession, where small phytoplankton become dominant, in the BS. In
   addition, the compositions of some long-chain FAs (>20, such as 20:0,
   20:1, 22:0 and 22:1n9) and n-ary sumation 18 indicated that the food
   chain based on flagellates and copepods was more apparent in
   TWW-controlled C. wilsoni, especially the effect of El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) on the variation of prey communities in
   TWW-controlled areas. FA markers such as SFA/(PUFA+MUFA), n-ary sumation
   15 + n-ary sumation 17 and ARA were more pronounced in TWW-controlled C.
   wilsoni, indicating a more strongly carnivorous and benthic food source.
   In the TBW-TWW confluence, the complex hydrological structure, including
   the presence of a large number of mesoscale eddies, allows rich
   nutrients and krill larvae to remain in it, providing a rich food source
   for the C. wilsoni. Overall, the FA data of this study show that the
   diet of C. wilsoni varies in different marine environments, aiding their
   survivability at the face of climate change.},

Title = {Using seabird and whale distribution models to estimate spatial
   consumption of krill to inform fishery management},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ecosystem dynamics at the northwest Antarctic Peninsula are driven by
   interactions between physical and biological processes. For example,
   baleen whale populations are recovering from commercial harvesting
   against the backdrop of rapid climate change, including reduced sea ice
   extent and changing ecosystem composition. Concurrently, the commercial
   harvesting of Antarctic krill is increasing, with the potential to
   increase the likelihood for competition with and between krill predators
   and the fishery. However, understanding the ecology, abundance, and
   spatial distribution of krill predators is often limited, outdated, or
   at spatial scales that do not match those desired for effective
   fisheries management. We update current knowledge of predator dependence
   on krill by integrating telemetry-based data, at-sea observational
   surveys, estimates of predator abundance, and physiological data to
   estimate the spatial distribution of krill consumption during the
   austral summer by three species of Pygoscelis penguin, 11 species of
   flying seabirds, one species of pinniped, and two species of baleen
   whale. Our models show that the majority of important areas for krill
   predator foraging are close to penguin breeding colonies in nearshore
   areas where humpback whales also regularly feed, and along the
   shelf-break, though we caution that not all known krill predators are
   included in these analyses. We show that krill consumption is highly
   variable across the region, and often concentrated at fine spatial
   scales, emphasizing the need for the management of the local krill
   fishery at relevant temporal and spatial scales. We also note that krill
   consumption by recovering populations of krill predators provides
   further evidence in support of the krill surplus hypothesis, and
   highlight that despite less than comprehensive data, cetaceans are
   likely to consume a significant proportion of the krill consumed by
   natural predators but are not currently considered directly in the
   management of the krill fishery. If management of the krill fishery is
   to be precautionary and operate in a way that minimizes the risks to
   krill predator populations, it will be necessary in future analyses, to
   include up-to-date and precise abundance and consumption estimates for
   pack-ice seals, finfish, squid, and other baleen whale species not
   currently considered.},

Title = {Using habitat models for chinstrap penguins, Pygoscelis antarctica, to
   inform marine spatial management around the South Sandwich Islands
   during the penguin breeding season},
Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {199},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {If not carefully managed, harvesting of Antarctic krill risks disturbing
   the ecological balance of many Antarctic and sub-Antarctic sites where
   krill-dependent predators feed. One of the least disturbed sites
   anywhere within the Southern Ocean and one where krill fishing has so
   far been virtually non-existent is the South Sandwich Islands volcanic
   archipelago. Some of the main krill predators breeding at the South
   Sandwich Islands are penguins, with five species breeding on the
   islands, the dominant species of which is the chinstrap penguin. In this
   paper we report on the results of ARGOS PTT deployments during the
   chinstrap penguin chick-rearing period, using the recorded foraging
   trips to develop habitat models. Foraging habitats used by chinstrap
   penguins during this period were best characterised by distance from the
   colony and sea surface temperature and, using these two covariates, we
   predicted the chick-rearing foraging habitat use around all islands. We
   show that the provisions of the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands
   Marine Protected Area ensure that chinstrap penguins, and other
   krill-dependent predators with similar foraging ranges, likely have
   robust protection during the summer. During the winter, when krill
   predators are likely to forage further offshore, seasonal sea ice
   provides a physical barrier to exclude the fishery, again ensuring the
   islands??? unique biodiversity receives strong protection. However, to
   the north of the marginal sea ice zone, competition between krill
   predators and the fishery could exist if the fishery were ever to
   explore new locations for resource extraction. We make a number of
   conclusions, including the need for winter tracking data to inform
   future management options.},

Title = {Individual and joint estimation of humpback whale migratory patterns and
   their environmental drivers in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) perform seasonal migrations
   from high latitude feeding grounds to low latitude breeding and calving
   grounds. Feeding grounds at polar regions are currently experiencing
   major ecosystem modifications, therefore, quantitatively assessing
   species responses to habitat characteristics is crucial for
   understanding how whales might respond to such modifications. We
   analyzed satellite telemetry data from 22 individual humpback whales in
   the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWA). Tagging effort was divided in two
   periods, 2003-2012 and 2016-2019. Correlations between whale's movement
   parameters and environmental variables were used as proxy for inferring
   behavioral responses to environmental variation. Two versions of a
   covariate-driven continuous-time correlated random-walk state-space
   model, were fitted to the data: i) Population-level models (P-models),
   which assess correlation parameters pooling data across all individuals
   or groups, and ii) individual-level models (I-models), fitted
   independently for each tagged whale. Area of Restricted Search behavior
   (slower and less directionally persistent movement, ARS) was
   concentrated at cold waters south of the Polar Front (similar to 50
   degrees S). The best model showed that ARS was expected to occur in
   coastal areas and over ridges and seamounts. Ice coverage during August
   of each year was a consistent predictor of ARS across models. Wind
   stress curl and sea surface temperature anomalies were also correlated
   with movement parameters but elicited larger inter-individual variation.
   I-models were consistent with P-models' predictions for the case of
   females accompanied by calves (mothers), while males and those of
   undetermined sex (males +) presented more variability as a group.
   Spatial predictions of humpback whale behavioral responses showed that
   feeding grounds for this population are concentrated in the complex
   system of islands, ridges, and rises of the Scotia Sea and the northern
   Weddell Ridge. More southernly incursions were observed in recent years,
   suggesting a potential response to increased temperature and large ice
   coverage reduction observed in the late 2010s. Although, small sample
   size and differences in tracking duration precluded appropriately
   testing predictions for such a distributional shift, our modelling
   framework showed the efficiency of borrowing statistical strength during
   data pooling, while pinpointing where more complexity should be added in
   the future as additional data become available.},

Abstract = {Antarctic krill is the key species of ecological system in the Amundsen
   Sea. At present, the suitable distribution is unobtainable by scientific
   surveys or data from the fishery. In this paper, the maximum entropy
   algorithm (Maxent) was used to obtain the potential distribution of
   adult Antarctic krill in order to provide useful information and
   reasonable reference for the policy on protecting potential krill
   habitats around the Amundsen Sea. Occurrence points and 17 environmental
   variables were used to simulate the distributions. Results show that the
   high and moderate suitable habitats lie between 65 degrees S and 72
   degrees S in the Amundsen Sea. The high suitable habitat accounts for
   8.1\% of the total area of the Amundsen Sea. The sea ice persistence
   (ICE), total phytoplankton (PHYC), and the minimum value of dissolved
   iron (Fe\_min) are the three dominant contributors to the model. Results
   from the response curves show that Antarctic krill preferred habitats
   with ICE of 0.42-0.93, PHYC of 2.48-2.77 mmol/m(3) and Fe\_min of
   (7.10x10(-5))-(9.45x10(-5)) mmol/m(3). Positive trends existed in the
   PHYC of the high and moderate suitable habitat, and a positive trend
   existed in the Fe\_min of moderate suitable habitat. However, the
   probability of presence of Antarctic krill will decrease if the increase
   of the PHYC and Fe\_min continues.},

Abstract = {This study was performed to aid the management of the fishery for
   Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Krill are an important component of
   the Antarctic marine ecosystem, providing a key food source for many
   marine predators. Additionally, krill are the target of the largest
   commercial fishery in the Southern Ocean, for which annual catches have
   been increasing and concentrating in recent years. The krill fishery is
   managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
   Living Resources (CCAMLR), which has endorsed a new management framework
   that requires information about the spatial distribution and biomass of
   krill. Here, we use krill density estimates from acoustic surveys and a
   GAMM framework to model habitat properties associated with high krill
   biomass during summer and winter in the northern Antarctic Peninsula
   region, an area important to the commercial fishery. Our models show
   elevated krill density associated with the shelf break, increased sea
   surface temperature, moderate chlorophyll-a concentration and increased
   salinity. During winter, our models show associations with shallow
   waters (< 1500 m) with low sea-ice concentration, medium sea-level
   anomaly and medium current speed. Our models predict temporal averages
   of the distribution and density of krill, which can be used to aid
   CCAMLR's revised ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Our models
   have the potential to help in the spatial and temporal design of future
   acoustic surveys that would preclude the need for modelled
   extrapolations. We highlight that the ecosystem approach to fisheries
   management of krill critically depends upon such field observations at
   relevant spatial and temporal scales.},

Abstract = {Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are showing strong recovery
   from commercial whaling in the western South Atlantic. In this region,
   humpback whales migrate annually from their winter breeding grounds off
   the coast of Brazil to their summer feeding grounds near to the Polar
   Front, an area that includes the waters of South Georgia and the South
   Sandwich Islands (SGSSI). This latter region includes a Marine Protected
   Area (MPA), which has been developed to ensure sustainable management of
   fisheries, and protection of foraging predators. To date, management
   measures within the MPA have primarily been concerned with foraging
   predators that rely upon Antarctic krill, including for a number of
   previously over-exploited species. With humpback whales increasing in
   the western South Atlantic, understandingnderstanding their
   spatiotemporal distribution within the MPA is important as it will help
   inform management particularly in respect of interactions between
   humpback whales and the regional fishery for Antarctic krill. Here we
   develop habitat models from the distribution and movement patterns of 16
   individuals at their high-latitude feeding grounds, south of 50 degrees
   S. We show that whale habitat use varies throughout the foraging period.
   Upon reaching their feeding ground, whales use the area to the east of
   the South Sandwich Islands, moving westward into the centre of the
   Scotia Arc and towards South Georgia during the high summer, and then
   expanding back towards the east in the winter. Based on these findings,
   we discuss the implications for the future, including necessary research
   required for underpinning management.},

Title = {Mercury biomagnification in an Antarctic food web of the Antarctic
   Peninsula},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {304},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Under the climate change context, warming Southern Ocean waters may
   allow mercury (Hg) to become more bioavailable to the Antarctic marine
   food web (i.e., ice-stored Hg release and higher methylation rates by
   mi-croorganisms), whose biomagnification processes are poorly
   documented. Biomagnification of Hg in the food web of the Antarctic
   Peninsula, one of the world's fastest-warming regions, was examined
   using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope
   ratios for estimating feeding habitat and trophic levels, respectively.
   The stable isotope signatures and total Hg (T-Hg) concentrations were
   measured in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and several Antarctic
   predator species, including seabirds (gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua,
   chinstrap penguins Pygoscelis antarcticus, brown skuas Stercorarius
   antarcticus, kelp gulls Larus dominicanus, southern giant petrels
   Macronectes giganteus) and marine mammals (southern elephant seals
   Mirounga leonina). Significant differences in delta C-13 values among
   species were noted with a great overlap between seabird species and M.
   leonina. As expected, significant differences in delta N-15 values among
   species were found due to interspecific variations in diet-related to
   their trophic position within the marine food web. The lowest Hg
   concentrations were registered in E. superba (0.007 +/- 0.008 mu g
   g(-1)) and the highest values in M. giganteus (12.090 +/- 14.177 mu g
   g(-1)). Additionally, a significant positive relationship was found
   between Hg concentrations and trophic levels (reflected by delta N-15
   values), biomagnifying nearly 2 times its concentrations at each level.
   Our results support that trophic interaction is the major pathway for Hg
   biomagnification in Southern Ocean ecosystems and warn about an increase
   in the effects of Hg on long-lived (and high trophic level) Antarctic
   predators under climate change in the future.},

Title = {Summer sea-ice variability on the Antarctic margin during the last

Abstract = {Antarctic sea ice is a critical component of the climate system
   affecting a range of physical and biogeochemical feedbacks and
   supporting unique ecosystems. During the last glacial stage, Antarctic
   sea ice was more extensive than today, but uncertainties in geological
   (marine sediments), glaciological (ice core), and climate model
   reconstructions of past sea-ice extent continue to limit our
   understanding of its role in the Earth system. Here, we present a novel
   archive of past sea-ice environments from regurgitated stomach oils of
   snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) preserved at nesting sites in Dronning
   Maud Land, Antarctica. We show that by combining information from fatty
   acid distributions and their stable carbon isotope ratios with
   measurements of bulk carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and trace metal
   data, it is possible to reconstruct changing snow petrel diet within
   Marine Isotope Stage 2 (ca. 24.3-30.3 cal kyr BP). We show that, as
   today, a mixed diet of krill and fish characterizes much of the record.
   However, between 27.4 and 28.7 cal kyr BP signals of krill almost
   disappear. By linking dietary signals in the stomach-oil deposits to
   modern feeding habits and foraging ranges, we infer the use by snow
   petrels of open-water habitats ({''}polynyas{''}) in the sea ice during
   our interval of study. The periods when consumption of krill was reduced
   are interpreted to correspond to the opening of polynyas over the
   continental shelf, which became the preferred foraging habitat. Our
   results show that extensive, thick, and multiyear sea ice was not always
   present close to the continent during the last glacial stage and
   highlight the potential of stomach-oil deposits as a palaeoenvironmental
   archive of Southern Ocean conditions.},

Title = {Modelling the effects of food limitation and temperature on the growth
   and reproduction of the krill Nyctiphanes australis},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {268},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {The krill Nyctiphanes australis is the most abundant and ecologically
   important euphausiid in southern Australia and New Zealand coastal and
   shelf waters. The species lives in coastal environments which are
   currently susceptible to shifts in temperature and productivity. Due to
   its abundance, it sustains many inshore fisheries and, for this reason,
   determining the potential outcome of future changes in sea temperature
   and productivity for Nyctiphanes is important. The temperature-and
   food-dependence of growth and reproduction of Nyctiphanes species can be
   made through Dynamic Energy Budget models (DEB), developed here to
   quantify how temperature and food availability affects growth,
   fecundity, egg size, and the energetic content of the eggs throughout
   the krill life-span. The DEB model predictions are in good agreement
   with measured life-history traits for the species and show that krill
   grows slower during winter while females do not always reach sexual
   maturity when temperatures are below 8 C and food levels are low. We
   found that higher temperatures and low food levels decrease the
   energetic content and diameter of the eggs by similar to 20\%, affecting
   the length and age at which N. australis commence reproduction. Under
   current scenarios of future ocean warming, these results indicate that
   populations of N. australis are likely to decline, with potential
   knock-on effects on coastal marine ecosystems and inshore fisheries.},

Abstract = {To understand the environmental factors affecting the density of
   foraging seabirds across the cold-water belt in the southwestern Okhotsk
   Sea, we conducted a 1-day (180-km transect length) shipboard seabird
   survey off the northeastern coast of Hokkaido during summer in 2019,
   along with acoustic observations of potential prey (zooplankton and
   fish) biomass, thermosalinograph measurements, and CTD observations.
   Planktivorous short-tailed shearwaters Ardenna tenuirostris (66\% of
   total seabirds) and piscivorous rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata
   (28\%) were predominant, but foraged in contrasting habitats. A large
   foraging flock of shearwaters was observed in the cold-water belt zone,
   including its front with coastal Soya Warm Current Water and the
   offshore Fresh Surface Okhotsk Sea Water, where surface chlorophyll a
   concentrations were the highest but not related to their prey
   (zooplankton) biomass at any spatial scale between 4.6 and 9.2 km. In
   contrast, the density of auklets was high in the coastal Soya Warm
   Current Water, where the acoustically determined fish biomass was large,
   and showed a positive relationship with the fish biomass especially in
   the lower layer (29-104 m depth) at any spatial scale. This
   species-specific difference in response to prey biomass might be related
   to prey-searching behaviors; i.e., rhinoceros auklets search prey
   underwater visually, but short-tailed shearwater can use both visual and
   olfactory cues to locate zooplankton patches from the air.},

Title = {Large mesopelagic fish biomass in the Southern Ocean resolved by

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {289},

Month = {JAN 26},
Abstract = {The oceanic mesopelagic zone, 200-1000 m below sea level, holds abundant
   small fishes that play central roles in ecosystem function. Global
   mesopelagic fish biomass estimates are increasingly derived using active
   acoustics, where echosounder-generated signals are emitted, reflected by
   pelagic organisms and detected by transducers on vessels. Previous
   studies have interpreted a ubiquitous decline in acoustic reflectance
   towards the Antarctic continent as a reduction in mesopelagic fish
   biomass. Here, we use empirical data to estimate species-specific
   acoustic target strength for the dominant mesopelagic fish of the Scotia
   Sea in the Southern Ocean. We use these data, alongside estimates of
   fish relative abundance from net surveys, to interpret signals received
   in acoustic surveys and calculate mesopelagic biomass of the broader
   Southern Ocean. We estimate the Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish biomass
   to be approximately 274 million tonnes if Antarctic krill contribute to
   the acoustic signal, or 570 million tonnes if mesopelagic fish alone are
   responsible. These quantities are approximately 1.8 and 3.8 times
   greater than previous net-based biomass estimates. We also show a peak
   in fish biomass towards the seasonal ice-edge, corresponding to the
   preferred feeding grounds of penguins and seals, which may be at risk
   under future climate change scenarios. Our study provides new insights
   into the abundance and distributions of ecologically significant
   mesopelagic fish stocks across the Southern Ocean ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Primary production in the Southern Ocean is dominated by diatom-rich
   phytoplankton assemblages, whose individual physiological
   characteristics and community composition are strongly shaped by the
   environment, yet knowledge on how diatoms allocate cellular energy in
   response to ocean acidification (OA) is limited. Understanding such
   changes in allocation is integral to determining the nutritional quality
   of diatoms and the subsequent impacts on the trophic transfer of energy
   and nutrients. Using synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared
   microspectroscopy, we analysed the macromolecular content of selected
   individual diatom taxa from a natural Antarctic phytoplankton community
   exposed to a gradient of fCO(2) levels (288-1263 mu atm). Strong
   species-specific differences in macromolecular partitioning were
   observed under OA. Large taxa showed preferential energy allocation
   towards proteins, while smaller taxa increased both lipid and protein
   stores at high fCO(2). If these changes are representative of future
   Antarctic diatom physiology, we may expect a shift away from lipid-rich
   large diatoms towards a community dominated by smaller taxa, but with
   higher lipid and protein stores than their present-day contemporaries, a
   response that could have cascading effects on food web dynamics in the
   Antarctic marine ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Accumulation of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in Antarctic krill
   (Euphausia superba), a keystone species in the Southern Ocean, is
   potentially harmful to the Antarctic ecosystem and human health. In the
   current study, we collected E. superba specimens (including muscle and
   carapace tissues) from Bransfield Strait in northern Antarctic Peninsula
   and South Georgia to analyze the profile, influencing factors and
   mechanisms of OCPs bioaccumulation in them. Results indicated that the
   biological traits (813C, 815N and lipid contents) of krill were
   significantly affected by habitat. There may exist growth dilution of
   OCPs in Antarctic krill and no fresh OCPs input in Antarctica, except
   for endosulfan I. Based on lipid-normalized concentrations, no
   significant differences were observed between the two regions at most
   sampling sites. However, OCP levels showed tissue and sex dependence.
   Boosted regression trees (BRTs) and partial least squares structural
   equation models (PLS-SEMs) were built to better investigate the main
   factors affecting the bioaccumulation of OCPs. Lipid content, negatively
   correlated with OCP levels, was the main factor. In vitro silicon
   modeling indicated that CYP3A4 metabolism capacity in krill contributed
   to the OCP residues except for endosulfan I. The results of this study
   expand current knowledge of OCPs in Antarctic marine biota, as well as
   their influencing factors and potential mechanisms.},

Title = {Dynamic Species Distribution Models in the Marine Realm: Predicting
   Year-Round Habitat Suitability of Baleen Whales in the Southern Ocean},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {08},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) relate species information to
   environmental conditions to predict potential species distributions. The
   majority of SDMs are static, relating species presence information to
   long-term average environmental conditions. The resulting temporal
   mismatch between species information and environmental conditions can
   increase model inference's uncertainty. For SDMs to capture the dynamic
   species-environment relationships and predict near-real-time habitat
   suitability, species information needs to be spatiotemporally matched
   with environmental conditions contemporaneous to the species' presence
   (dynamic SDMs). Implementing dynamic SDMs in the marine realm is highly
   challenging, particularly due to species and environmental data paucity
   and spatiotemporally biases. Here, we implemented presence-only dynamic
   SDMs for four migratory baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean (SO):
   Antarctic minke, Antarctic blue, fin, and humpback whales. Sightings
   were spatiotemporally matched with their respective daily environmental
   predictors. Background information was sampled daily to describe the
   dynamic environmental conditions in the highly dynamic SO. We corrected
   for spatial sampling bias by sampling background information respective
   to the seasonal research efforts. Independent model evaluation was
   performed on spatial and temporal cross-validation. We predicted the
   circumantarctic year-round habitat suitability of each species. Daily
   predictions were also summarized into bi-weekly and monthly habitat
   suitability. We identified important predictors and species suitability
   responses to environmental changes. Our results support the propitious
   use of dynamic SDMs to fill species information gaps and improve
   conservation planning strategies. Near-real-time predictions can be used
   for dynamic ocean management, e.g., to examine the overlap between
   habitat suitability and human activities. Nevertheless, the inevitable
   spatiotemporal biases in sighting data from the SO call for the need for
   improving sampling effort in the SO and using alternative data sources
   (e.g., passive acoustic monitoring) in future SDMs. We further discuss
   challenges of calibrating dynamic SDMs on baleen whale species in the
   SO, with a particular focus on spatiotemporal sampling bias issues and
   how background information should be sampled in presence-only dynamic
   SDMs. We also highlight the need to integrate visual and acoustic data
   in future SDMs on baleen whales for better coverage of environmental
   conditions suitable for the species and avoid constraints of using
   either data type alone.},

Title = {Stepping stones towards Antarctica: Switch to southern spawning grounds
   explains an abrupt range shift in krill},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1359-1375},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Poleward range shifts are a global-scale response to warming, but these
   vary greatly among taxa and are hard to predict for individual species,
   localized regions or over shorter (years to decadal) timescales. Moving
   poleward might be easier in the Arctic than in the Southern Ocean, where
   evidence for range shifts is sparse and contradictory. Here, we compiled
   a database of larval Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba and, together
   with an adult database, it showed how their range shift is out of step
   with the pace of warming. During a 70-year period of rapid warming
   (1920s-1990s), distribution centres of both larvae and adults in the SW
   Atlantic sector remained fixed, despite warming by 0.5-1.0 degrees C and
   losing sea ice. This was followed by a hiatus in surface warming and ice
   loss, yet during this period the distributions of krill life stages
   shifted greatly, by similar to 1000 km, to the south-west. Understanding
   the mechanism of such step changes is essential, since they herald
   system reorganizations that are hard to predict with current modelling
   approaches. We propose that the abrupt shift was driven by climatic
   controls acting on localized recruitment hotspots, superimposed on
   thermal niche conservatism. During the warming hiatus, the Southern
   Annular Mode index continued to become increasingly positive and, likely
   through reduced feeding success for larvae, this led to a precipitous
   decline in recruitment from the main reproduction hotspot along the
   southern Scotia Arc. This cut replenishment to the northern portion of
   the krill stock, as evidenced by declining density and swarm frequency.
   Concomitantly, a new, southern reproduction area developed after the
   1990s, reinforcing the range shift despite the lack of surface warming.
   New spawning hotspots may provide the stepping stones needed for range
   shifts into polar regions, so planning of climate-ready marine protected
   areas should include these key areas of future habitat.},

Title = {The ecosystem approach to management of the Antarctic krill fishery-the
   `devils are in the detail' at small spatial and temporal scales},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Fishery demand for Antarctic krill is increasing, and projected to
   continue increasing into the future. Krill has the potential to
   contribute approximately 10\% to all future marine landings, adding
   significantly to global food security. However, the fishery is
   effectively data-limited so is currently managed using precautionary
   assess-ments that relate to large spatial and temporal scales that
   preclude the need for fine-scale ecological data. To respond to recent
   changes in fishery operation and to mitigate possible ecological
   impacts, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
   Resources (CCAMLR) plans to revise its management strategy so that it
   takes into account ecosystem operation at smaller spatial and temporal
   scales, such as those relevant to krill-dependent predators. Here, we
   consider how catches in coastal areas potentially present challenges for
   these predators, where cumulative catches over the fishing season can
   sometimes be greater than local consumption by predators, and sometimes
   greater than the standing stock of krill within an area because of krill
   transport and replenishment by ocean currents. Protecting feeding areas
   used by land-based predators such as penguins and seals, whilst also
   offering a high level of protection for pelagic predators such as some
   species of fish and recovering populations of cetaceans, will require
   innovative solutions. We highlight critical ecological research needed
   to reduce management uncertainty. This is important as we demonstrate
   that krill consumption by predators in near-shore coastal habitats
   relies absolutely upon krill movement and oceanographic transport. We
   also highlight the need to improve understanding about krill behaviour,
   especially in relation to observed seasonal changes in krill biomass.
   Finally, we highlight that without up-to-date data about changes in
   krill, krill-dependent predator populations and their oceanographic
   environ-ment, management will remain challenging in the context of
   increasing fishing pressure, recovering populations of marine mammals
   and a changing climate.},

Abstract = {Detailed knowledge of habitat use by marine megafauna is critical to
   understand their ecological roles and for the adequate management of
   marine resources. Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) inhabiting
   the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean prey largely on Antarctic
   krill (Euphausia superba) and play a central role in managing the krill
   fishery. Here, we assessed the demographic structure of three
   post-mating, early moult male haul-outs in the South Shetland Islands in
   early March and calculated the relative contribution of juveniles (1-4
   years old) and sub-adult males (5-6 years) to the population remaining
   in maritime Antarctica after the breeding season. We also satellite
   tagged 11 juvenile males and four sub-adult males to analyze their
   movements and develop a species distribution model including both age
   classes. Our results highlighted the dominance of young individuals in
   the male population, revealed that they do not behave as central place
   foragers and identified key environmental drivers that affected their
   distribution at-sea throughout winter. Predicted potential foraging
   habitat overlapped highly with the known distribution of Antarctic
   krill, and identified the waters off the western Antarctic Peninsula and
   the Scotia Sea as the core of the distribution area of juvenile and
   sub-adult male Antarctic fur seals in winter. This pattern is similar to
   that of adult males but totally different from that of adult females, as
   the latter overwinter in areas at latitude 45-55 degrees S. This
   segregation has implications for the ecology and management of the krill
   fishery.},

Title = {An Integrated, Size-Structured Stock Assessment of Antarctic Krill,
   Euphausia superba},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery is the largest fishery
   in the Southern Ocean, and it has been operating for over 45 years. In
   the past decade, the spatial distribution of the krill fishery has
   focused on the Bransfield Strait off the Antarctic Peninsula (subarea
   48.1). However, the high fishing effort and climate change have placed
   great pressure on krill resources in this region, and conservation
   concerns have been raised. Because aging krill is difficult and
   uncertain, we developed an integrated size-structured model to estimate
   the fishing mortality, recruitment and spawning biomass of krill. The
   results indicated that in 1992-2011, the average spawning biomass of
   krill ranged from 1.14 x 10(6) to 1.45 x 10(6) tons, the estimated
   biomass of the maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) ranged from 3.96 x 10(5)
   to 4.90 x 10(5) tons and the estimated average recruitment ranged from
   2.3 x 10(12) to 5.03 x 10(12) individuals in the research area. We
   explored the effect of different data weighting schemes for the length
   data on the assessment output. However, our estimates also have
   uncertainties. In addition, an attempt was made to analyze the
   correlation between model-estimated recruitment and mature biomass with
   climate change. Future stock assessments of krill resources should be
   comprehensive and multimethod, and the management of krill resources
   should be based on science that considers the demand of fishing
   communities and ecosystem protection.},

Abstract = {Whales contribute to marine ecosystem functioning, and they may play a
   role in mitigating climate change and supporting the Antarctic krill
   (Euphausia superba) population, a keystone prey species that sustains
   the entire Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystem. By analyzing a five-decade
   (1971-2017) data series of individual southern right whales (SRWs;
   Eubalaena australis) photo-identified at Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, we
   found a marked increase in whale mortality rates following El Nino
   events. By modeling how the population responds to changes in the
   frequency and intensity of El Nino events, we found that such events are
   likely to impede SRW population recovery and could even cause population
   decline. Such outcomes have the potential to disrupt food-web
   interactions in the SO, weakening that ecosystem's contribution to the
   mitigation of climate change at a global scale.},

Title = {Ice matters: Life-history strategies of two Antarctic seals dictate
   climate change eventualities in the Weddell Sea},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {23},
Pages = {6252-6262},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are
   not uniform and ice-obligate species with dissimilar life-history
   characteristics will likely respond differently to their changing
   ecosystems. We use a unique data set of Weddell Leptonychotes weddellii
   and crabeater seals' (CESs) Lobodon carcinophaga breeding season
   distribution in the Weddell Sea, determined from satellite imagery. We
   contrast the theoretical climate impacts on both ice-obligate predators
   who differ in life-history characteristics: CESs are highly specialized
   Antarctic krill Euphausia superba predators and breed in the seasonal
   pack ice; Weddell seals (WESs) are generalist predators and breed on
   comparatively stable fast ice. We used presence-absence data and a suite
   of remotely sensed environmental variables to build habitat models. Each
   of the environmental predictors is multiplied by a `climate change
   score' based on known responses to climate change to create a `change
   importance product'. Results show CESs are more sensitive to climate
   change than WESs. Crabeater seals prefer to breed close to krill, and
   the compounding effects of changing sea ice concentrations and sea
   surface temperatures, the proximity to krill and abundance of stable
   breeding ice, can influence their post-breeding foraging success and
   ultimately their future breeding success. But in contrast to the Ross
   Sea, here WESs prefer to breed closer to larger colonies of emperor
   penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). This suggests that the Weddell Sea may
   currently be prey-abundant, allowing the only two air-breathing
   Antarctic silverfish predators (Pleuragramma antarctica) (WESs and
   emperor penguins) to breed closer to each other. This is the first
   basin-scale, region-specific comparison of breeding season habitat in
   these two key Antarctic predators based on real-world data to compare
   climate change responses. This work shows that broad-brush, basin-scale
   approaches to understanding species-specific responses to climate change
   are not always appropriate, and regional models are needed-especially
   when designing marine protected areas.},

Title = {Parasites of Three Closely Related Antarctic Fish Species (Teleostei:

Journal = {ACTA PARASITOLOGICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {218-232},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background Studies of parasite communities and patterns in the Antarctic
   are an important knowledge base with the potential to track shifts in
   ecological relations and study the effects of climate change on
   host-parasite systems. Endemic Nototheniinae is the dominant fish group
   found in Antarctic marine habitats. Through their intermediate position
   within the food web, Nototheniinae link lower to higher trophic levels
   and thereby also form an important component of parasite life cycles.
   The study was set out to gain insight into the parasite fauna of
   Nototheniops larseni, N. nudifrons and Lepidonotothen squamifrons
   (Nototheniinae) from Elephant Island (Antarctica). Methods Sampling was
   conducted at three locations around Elephant Island during the
   ANT-XXVIII/4 expedition of the research vessel Polarstern. The parasite
   fauna of three Nototheniine species was analysed, and findings were
   compared to previous parasitological and ecological research collated
   from a literature review. Results All host species shared the parasites
   Neolebouria antarctica (Digenea), Corynosoma bullosum (Acanthocephala)
   and Pseudoterranova decipiens E (Nematoda). Other parasite taxa were
   exclusive to one host species in this study. Nototheniops nudifrons was
   infected by Ascarophis nototheniae (Nematoda), occasional infections of
   N. larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi (Acanthocephala) and L.
   squamifrons with Elytrophalloides oatesi (Digenea) and larval
   tetraphyllidean Cestoda were detected. Conclusion All examined fish
   species' parasites were predominantly euryxenous regarding their fish
   hosts. The infection of Lepidonotothen squamifrons with Lepidapedon
   garrardi (Digenea) and Nototheniops larseni with Echinorhynchus
   petrotschenkoi represent new host records. Despite the challenges and
   limited opportunities for fishing in remote areas, future studies should
   continue sampling on a more regular basis and include a larger number of
   fish species and sampling sites within different habitats.},

Title = {Salp fecal pellets release more bioavailable iron to Southern Ocean

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {13},

Month = {JUL 12},
Abstract = {Over the last decades, it has been reported that the habitat of the
   Southern Ocean (SO) key species Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has
   contracted to high latitudes, putatively due to reduced winter sea ice
   coverage, while salps as Salpa thompsoni have extended their dispersal
   to the former krill habitats. To date, the potential implications of
   this population shift on the biogeochemical cycling of the limiting
   micronutrient iron (Fe) and its bioavailability to SO phytoplankton has
   never been tested. Based on uptake of fecal pellet (FP)released Fe by SO
   phytoplankton, this study highlights how efficiently krill and salps
   recycle Fe. To test this, we collected FPs of natural populations of
   salps and krill, added them to the same SO phytoplankton community,
   andmeasured the community's Fe uptake rates. Our results reveal that
   both FP additions yielded similar dissolved iron concentrations in the
   seawater. Per FP carbon added to the seawater, 4.8 +/- 1.5 times more Fe
   was taken up by the same phytoplankton community from salp FP than from
   krill FP, suggesting that salp FP increased the Fe bioavailability,
   possibly through the release of ligands. With respect to the ongoing
   shift from krill to salps, the potential for carbon fixation of the
   Fe-limited SO could be strengthened in the future, representing a
   negative feedback to climate change.},

Title = {Sympatry and resource partitioning between the largest krill consumers
   around the Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {669},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Understanding how closely related, sympatric species distribute
   themselves relative to their environment is critical to understanding
   ecosystem structure and function and predicting effects of environmental
   variation. The Antarctic Peninsula supports high densities of krill and
   krill consumers; however, the region is warming rapidly, with unknown
   consequences. Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and Antarctic minke
   whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis are the largest krill consumers here,
   yet key data gaps remain about their distribution, behavior, and
   interactions and how these will be impacted by changing conditions.
   Using satellite telemetry and novel spatial point-process modeling
   techniques, we quantified habitat use of each species relative to
   dynamic environmental variables and determined overlap in core habitat
   areas during summer months when sea ice is at a minimum. We found that
   humpback whales ranged broadly over continental shelf waters, utilizing
   nearshore bays, while minke whales restricted their movements to
   sheltered bays and areas where ice is present. This presents a scenario
   where minke whale core habitat overlaps substantially with the broader
   home ranges of humpback whales. While there is no indication that prey
   is limiting in this ecosystem, increased overlap between these species
   may arise as climate-driven changes that affect the extent, timing, and
   duration of seasonal sea ice decrease the amount of preferred foraging
   habitat for minke whales while concurrently increasing it for humpback
   whales. Our results provide the first quantitative assessment of
   behaviorally based habitat use and sympatry between these 2 krill
   consumers and offers insight into the potential effects of a rapidly
   changing environment on the structure and function of a polar ecosystem.},

Title = {Environmental drivers of the physiological condition of mature female
   Antarctic krill during the spawning season: implications for krill
   recruitment},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {669},
Pages = {65-82},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Southern Ocean pelagic productivity relies on the abundance of Antarctic
   krill Euphausia superba, which fluctuates on a 5-7 yr cycle and is
   driven by interannual variability in recruitment. The western Antarctic
   Peninsula (wAP) is home to a significant proportion of the
   circum-Antarctic krill biomass and is the focus of the krill fishery.
   The wAP is warming at a rate quicker than most other places on Earth,
   with notable regional changes in the pelagic ecosystem. There is a major
   gap in our understanding of how environmental variability affects the
   reproductive success of krill. We used historical krill population data
   collected at the wAP (January 1993-2008, Palmer Antarctica Long Term
   Ecological Research) to assess the effects of environmental variability
   on the condition of mature female krill during the spawning season and
   its relationship with krill recruitment. Mature female krill condition
   during the spawning season was positively correlated with recruitment
   the subsequent year. Results of generalized additive models indicated
   that the predominant drivers of krill condition during the spawning
   season were climatological (Southern Annular Mode and Multivariate El
   Nino Southern Oscillation Index), though the timing of sea ice advance
   and retreat, and diatom concentrations were also important Gaining a
   better understanding of the oceanographic and climatological factors
   that affect the physiological condition of mature female krill is
   critical for predicting future demographic patterns and responses to
   change. Results from our study emphasize the importance of including the
   effects of climate change in the management models for the Antarctic
   krill fishery.},

Abstract = {In contrast to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, Antarctic salps (Salpa
   thompsoni) respond positively to warmer water temperatures and have the
   ability to create massive blooms under favourable conditions. Therefore,
   they can compete with krill for primary production. Over the last three
   decades, significant variability in S. thompsoni occurrence has been
   observed as a response to the environmental fluctuations of the Southern
   Ocean ecosystem (e.g. changes in sea surface temperature and ice-cover
   shrinkage around the cold Antarctic waters). This study presents
   historical abundance data of salps from the south-west Atlantic Sector
   of the Southern Ocean, covering a time span of 26 years. These data
   allow tracking of fluctuations in Antarctic salp abundance and their
   distribution with bottom depth, temperature, and ice conditions, aiming
   to reveal salp hot spots and to predict the future range of S. thompsoni
   distribution with upcoming climate warming in the next 50 years. Results
   showed the highest salp density in shallow shelf waters with ice cover
   and low temperatures between 1 and -1 degrees C. In the studied area, S.
   thompsoni hot spots were located mostly around Elephant Island, but also
   the islands around Brensfield and Gerlache Straits, as well as to the
   south near the Bellingshausen Sea. Inferences made of future salp
   distribution suggest that the range of S. thompsoni will move
   southwards, enlarging their habitat area by nearly 500,000 km(2), which
   may have significant implications on the whole Antarctic food web. The
   information presented herein may be used for Antarctic ecosystem
   management, protection, and conservation.},

Title = {Overwinter sea-ice characteristics important for Antarctic krill
   recruitment in the southwest Atlantic},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate change alters the extent and structure of sea-ice environments,
   which affects how they function as a habitat for polar species.
   Identifying sea-ice characteristics that serve as indicators of habitat
   quality will be crucial to the monitoring and management of climate
   change impacts. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill is a key prey
   species and fishery target. Krill larvae depend upon sea-ice habitats to
   survive the winter and recruit to the population in spring. Existing
   observations of sea-ice characteristics lack sufficient spatiotemporal
   coverage to quantify which ones contribute to favourable overwintering
   habitat, leading to uncertainties in how current and future changes in
   sea ice affect krill populations. Here, we derive regional-scale indices
   of annual krill recruitment spanning 35 years across the southwest
   Atlantic. To develop meaningful indicators of sea-ice habitat, we
   selected variables from a high-resolution sea-ice model that are
   hypothesized as relevant for larval habitat use. The resulting
   correlations between recruitment and sea-ice indicators vary by region
   and show remote connections to sea ice that correspond with established
   theories of larval transport. Through an improved representation of
   sea-ice habitat quality, as compared with using more traditional
   satellite-derived variables such as sea-ice extent and duration, we
   highlight plausible regions of overwintering habitat. Our findings
   improve current understanding of how krill are likely responding to
   changing sea ice and support emerging views that larval habitat use is
   complex. Furthermore, regional variation in larval dependence on sea ice
   may provide pockets of resilience to change for the broader krill
   population.},

Title = {Modeling Antarctic Krill Circumpolar Spawning Habitat Quality to
   Identify Regions With Potential to Support High Larval Production},

Abstract = {Antarctic krill (krill) are important within Southern Ocean ecosystems
   and support an expanding fishery. Toward understanding krill's response
   to environmental change, it is necessary to identify regions that
   support high krill larval production (spawning habitat). We develop a
   mechanistic model combining thermal and food requirements for krill egg
   production, with predation pressure post-spawning, to predict regions of
   high-quality spawning habitat. We optimize our model regionally and
   generate circumpolar predictions of spawning habitat quality. Our
   results indicate the southwest Atlantic accounts for almost half of all
   predicted high-quality spawning habitat. Small-scale management units
   (SSMUs) around the Antarctic Peninsula had high coverage of high-quality
   spawning habitat. In contrast, the remaining SSMUs (except around South
   Georgia) were poorly covered, suggestive of population sinks reliant on
   input from external sources upstream. This implies strong potential for
   downstream impacts of fishing in key spawning areas, with implications
   for management of SSMUs and the krill fishery.},

Title = {Detecting Climate Signals in Southern Ocean Krill Growth Habitat},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Climate change is rapidly altering the habitat of Antarctic krill
   (Euphausia superba), a key species of the Southern Ocean food web. Krill
   are a critical element of Southern Ocean ecosystems as well as
   biogeochemical cycles, while also supporting an international commercial
   fishery. In addition to trends forced by global-scale, human-driven
   warming, the Southern Ocean is highly dynamic, displaying large
   fluctuations in surface climate on interannual to decadal timescales.
   The dual roles of forced climate change and natural variability
   affecting Antarctic krill habitat, and therefore productivity,
   complicate interplay of observed trends and contribute to uncertainty in
   future projections. We use the Community Earth System Model Large
   Ensemble (CESM-LE) coupled with an empirically derived model of krill
   growth to detect and attribute trends associated with ``forced,{''}
   human-driven climate change, distinguishing these from variability
   arising naturally. The forced trend in krill growth is characterized by
   a poleward contraction of optimal conditions and an overall reduction in
   Southern Ocean krill habitat. However, the amplitude of natural climate
   variability is relatively large, such that the forced trend cannot be
   formally distinguished from natural variability at local scales over
   much of the Southern Ocean by 2100. Our results illustrate how natural
   variability is an important driver of regional krill growth trends and
   can mask the forced trend until late in the 21st century. Given the
   ecological and commercial global importance of krill, this research
   helps inform current and future Southern Ocean krill management in the
   context of climate variability and change.},

Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {258},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Drastic sea ice retreats in the Antarctic Peninsula, and the consequent
   environmental changes have brought about the consequences of biological
   adaptation and food competition. The isotopic niche is reflected by the
   ecological position and functional role of a species, which can be
   altered depending on these environmental changes. We assessed the
   isotopic niche and trophic positions (TP) of 3 seabirds on the Barton
   Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, to understand ecological
   interaction among the species. The average TP of Antarctic krill
   (Euphausia superba) (hereafter ``krill{''}) (2.6 +/- 0.1) was estimated
   by using the compiled published data of the compound-specific nitrogen
   isotope ratio of glutamic acid and phenylalanine in the Southern Ocean,
   and TP values of the seabirds based on that of krill to be reliable
   according to ecological knowledge. Our results on the overlap of the
   isotopic niches of seabirds suggests potential diet competition among
   the consumers, such as the brown skua (Stercorarius antarcticus) and
   south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), whereas the distinct and
   broad isotopic niche width of kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) suggesting
   that their adaptation through generalization was related to their
   extended habitat and various food sources. Our research indicates that
   isotopic niche of seabirds reflects their survival strategy for food
   competition. Consequently, these seabirds can be easily influenced by
   alternative food sources, including terrestrial and human-derived
   sources, by rapid environmental changes, indicating that they are
   valuable as key environmental species and require long-term monitoring
   in the Antarctic Peninsula.},

Title = {Utilising IPCC assessments to support the ecosystem approach to
   fisheries management within a warming Southern Ocean},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {131},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Southern Ocean marine ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate-driven
   change, the impacts of which must be factored into conservation and
   management. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
   Living Resources (CCAMLR) is aware of the urgent need to develop
   climate-responsive options within its ecosystem approach to management.
   However, limited capacity as well as political differences have meant
   that little progress has been made. Strengthening scientific information
   flow to inform CCAMLR's decision-making on climate change may help to
   remove some of these barriers. On this basis, this study encourages the
   utilisation of outputs from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC's 2019 Special Report on the Ocean
   and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) constitutes the most
   rigorous and up-todate assessment of how oceans and the cryosphere are
   changing, how they are projected to change, and the consequences of
   those changes, together with a range of response options. To assist
   CCAMLR to focus on what is most useful from this extensive global
   report, SROCC findings that have specific relevance to the management of
   Southern Ocean ecosystems are extracted and summarised here. These
   findings are translated into recommendations to CCAMLR, emphasising the
   need to reduce and manage the risks that climate change presents to
   harvested species and the wider ecosystem of which they are part.
   Improved linkages between IPCC, CCAMLR and other relevant bodies may
   help overcome existing impediments to progress, enabling climate change
   to become fully integrated into CCAMLR's policy and decision-making.},

Title = {Evidence for the Impact of Climate Change on Primary Producers in the
   Southern Ocean},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Within the framework of the Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern
   Ocean (MEASO), this paper brings together analyses of recent trends in
   phytoplankton biomass, primary production and irradiance at the base of
   the mixed layer in the Southern Ocean and summarises future projections.
   Satellite observations suggest that phytoplankton biomass in the
   mixed-layer has increased over the last 20 years in most (but not all)
   parts of the Southern Ocean, whereas primary production at the base of
   the mixed-layer has likely decreased over the same period. Different
   satellite models of primary production (Vertically Generalised versus
   Carbon Based Production Models) give different patterns and directions
   of recent change in net primary production (NPP). At present, the
   satellite record is not long enough to distinguish between trends and
   climate-related cycles in primary production. Over the next 100 years,
   Earth system models project increasing NPP in the water column in the
   MEASO northern and Antarctic zones but decreases in the Subantarctic
   zone. Low confidence in these projections arises from: (1) the
   difficulty in mapping supply mechanisms for key nutrients (silicate,
   iron); and (2) understanding the effects of multiple stressors
   (including irradiance, nutrients, temperature, pCO(2), pH, grazing) on
   different species of Antarctic phytoplankton. Notwithstanding these
   uncertainties, there are likely to be changes to the seasonal patterns
   of production and the microbial community present over the next 50-100
   years and these changes will have ecological consequences across
   Southern Ocean food-webs, especially on key species such as Antarctic
   krill and silverfish.},

Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Survival of larval Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) during winter is
   largely dependent upon the presence of sea ice as it provides an
   important source of food and shelter. We hypothesized that sea ice
   provides additional benefits because it hosts fewer competitors and
   provides reduced predation risk for krill larvae than the water column.
   To test our hypothesis, zooplankton were sampled in the Weddell-Scotia
   Confluence Zone at the ice-water interface (0-2 m) and in the water
   column (0-500 m) during August-October 2013. Grazing by mesozooplankton,
   expressed as a percentage of the phytoplankton standing stock, was
   higher in the water column (1.97 +/- 1.84\%) than at the ice-water
   interface (0.08 +/- 0.09\%), due to a high abundance of pelagic
   copepods. Predation risk by carnivorous macrozooplankton, expressed as a
   percentage of the mesozooplankton standing stock, was significantly
   lower at the ice-water interface (0.83 +/- 0.57\%; main predators
   amphipods, siphonophores and ctenophores) than in the water column (4.72
   +/- 5.85\%; main predators chaetognaths and medusae). These results
   emphasize the important role of sea ice as a suitable winter habitat for
   larval krill with fewer competitors and lower predation risk. These
   benefits should be taken into account when considering the response of
   Antarctic krill to projected declines in sea ice. Whether reduced
   sea-ice algal production may be compensated for by increased water
   column production remains unclear, but the shelter provided by sea ice
   would be significantly reduced or disappear, thus increasing the

Abstract = {Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a key species in the Southern
   Ocean, where its habitat is projected to undergo continued warming and
   increases in pCO(2). Experiments during 2 summer field seasons at Palmer
   Station, Antarctica, investigated the independent and interactive
   effects of elevated temperature and pCO(2) (decreased pH) on feeding,
   growth, acid-base physiology, metabolic rate, and survival of adult
   Antarctic krill. Ingestion and clearance rates of chlorophyll were
   depressed under low pH (7.7) compared to ambient pH (8.1) after a 48 h
   acclimation period, but this difference disappeared after a 21 d
   acclimation. Growth rates were negligible and frequently negative, but
   were significantly more negative at high (3 degrees C, -0.03 mm d(-1))
   compared to ambient temperature (0 degrees C, -0.01 mm d(-1)) with no
   effect of pH. Modest elevations in tissue total CO2 and tissue pH were
   apparent at low pH but were short-lived. Metabolic rate increased with
   temperature but was suppressed at low pH in smaller but not larger
   krill. Although effects of elevated temperature and/or decreased pH were
   mostly sublethal, mortality was higher at high temperature/low pH (58\%)
   compared to ambient temperature/pH or ambient temperature/low pH (>
   90\%). This study identified 3 dominant patterns: (1) shorter-term
   effects were primarily pH-dependent; (2) krill compensated for lower pH
   relatively quickly; and (3) longer-term effects on krill growth and
   survival were strongly driven by temperature with little to no pH
   effect.},

Title = {Facing Southern Ocean warming: Temperature effects on whole animal
   performance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)},
Journal = {ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {146},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The ongoing environmental changes in the Southern Ocean may cause a
   dramatic decrease in habitat quality. Due to its central position in the
   food web, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species of the
   marine Antarctic ecosystem. It is therefore crucial to understand how
   increasing water temperatures affect important krill life-cycle
   processes. Here, a long-term (August - March) laboratory acclimation
   experiment at different temperature scenarios (0.5 degrees C, 1.5
   degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, 3.5 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 7 degrees C) was
   performed and the effects of elevated temperatures on whole animal
   parameters (O2 consumption, body length, length of the digestive gland)
   were analyzed. The response of krill oxygen consumption to different
   experimental temperatures differed between acute/short-term and
   long-term acclimation. After 8 months, krill oxygen consumption remained
   unchanged up to temperatures of 3.5 degrees C and was significantly
   higher at temperatures > 3.5 degrees C. Krill acclimated to temperatures
   > 3.5 degrees C were significantly smaller at the end of the experiment.
   Limited food intake and/or conversion may have contributed to this
   effect, especially pronounced after the onset of the reproductive
   period. In addition, the seasonal growth pattern in males differed from
   that of females. Together, our findings indicate that warming Southern
   Ocean waters are likely to increase metabolic rate in krill, possibly
   altering the amount of energy available for other important life-cycle
   processes, a finding directly related to future population dynamics and
   fisheries management.},

Title = {An integrated field-laboratory investigation of the effects of low
   oxygen and pH on North Pacific krill (Euphausia pacifica)},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Number = {4},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Krill are abundant and ecologically important zooplankton that inhabit
   dynamic environments characterized by strong natural variability, but
   global ocean change is shifting the range of conditions that they
   experience. Laboratory tests reveal that krill are sensitive to ocean
   acidification despite residing in naturally low pH areas, showing the
   importance of modulating factors for determining their responses. This
   study combines laboratory manipulations with field observations across a
   strong natural water chemistry gradient in Puget Sound, Washington, USA
   to investigate the effects of pH and oxygen on adult female North
   Pacific krill, Euphausia pacifica. Enzyme activities of the Electron
   Transport System (ETS) and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS) were used
   as indices of zooplankton metabolism and growth, respectively, and were
   paired with traditional incubation methods. Acclimation to pH and oxygen
   conditions in the laboratory did not reveal effects on respiration rate,
   ETS, or AARS activity of krill. However, field observations showed that
   respiratory potential, as estimated by ETS activity, decreased with
   decreasing oxygen, declining 9\% (95\% confidence interval 2.5-15\%)
   over the range of conditions we observed (3.9-8.1 mg O-2 L-1). This
   reduction would depress the metabolic potential of krill in areas of
   stressful conditions (concurrent low pH), though krill also displayed a
   high degree of inter-individual variability. Although differences in age
   structure suggest different patterns of recruitment between E. pacifica
   populations in areas with stressful conditions and those without,
   populations persist at stressful sites. Lower temperature of waters with
   low oxygen and pH, as well as high food concentrations, may contribute
   to these populations' success.},

Abstract = {The diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia
   is dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). During the breeding
   season, foraging trips by lactating female fur seals are constrained by
   their need to return to land to provision their pups. Post-breeding,
   seals disperse in order to feed and recover condition; estimates
   indicate c.70\% of females remain near to South Georgia, whilst others
   head west towards the Patagonian Shelf or south to the ice-edge. The
   krill fishery at South Georgia operates only during the winter,
   providing the potential for fur seal: fishery interaction during these
   months. Here we use available winter (May to September) tracking data
   from Platform Terminal Transmitter (PTT) tags deployed on female fur
   seals at Bird Island, South Georgia. We develop habitat models
   describing their distribution during the winters of 1999 and 2003 with
   the aim of visualising and quantifying the degree of spatial overlap
   between female fur seals and krill harvesting in South Georgia waters.
   We show that spatial distribution of fur seals around South Georgia is
   extensive, and that the krill fishery overlaps with small, highly
   localised areas of available fur seal habitat. From these findings we
   discuss the implications for management, and future work.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {After declining in abundance due to commercial whaling during the 20th
   century, populations of the Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus
   intermedia) have failed to recover to pre-exploitation levels. Using
   historical whaling data from 1926-1954, in combination with temperature
   data for the Southern Ocean, a gamma GLM with temporal dependency was
   fitted to 20,144 records of B. m. intermedia foetus size using Bayesian
   inference. There was a negative relationship between antecedent winter
   sea surface temperature (SST) in the Southern Ocean on foetus size. This
   relationship is proposed as being mediated by a positive effect of the
   extent of winter sea ice on Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) abundance
   on which B. m. intermedia feed. There was also a positive
   density-dependent effect of a ``krill surplus{''} at low B. m.
   intermedia population sizes. However, the positive effect of a ``krill
   surplus{''} at low B. m. intermedia population size on foetus growth was
   reversed at elevated winter SST due to a proposed negative impact on E.
   superba recruitment. Projected increases in temperature in the Southern
   Ocean are predicted to compromise the growth rates of B. m. intermedia
   foetuses, with implications for the capacity of the subspecies to
   recover from overexploitation.},

Title = {Future Risk for Southern Ocean Ecosystem Services Under Climate Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {The Southern Ocean supports ecosystem services that are important on a
   global scale. Climate change and human activities (tourism, fishing, and
   research) will affect both the demand for, and the provision of, these
   services into the future. Here we synthesize recent assessments of the
   current status and expected future climate-driven changes in Southern
   Ocean ecosystems and evaluate the potential consequences of these
   changes for the provision of ecosystem services. We explore in detail
   three key services (the `blue carbon' pathway, the Antarctic krill
   fishery, and Antarctic tourism), tracing the consequences of climate
   change from physical drivers through biological impacts to the benefits
   to humans. We consider potential non-climatic drivers of change, current
   and future demands for the services, and the main global and regional
   policy frameworks that could be used to manage risks to the provision of
   these services in a changing climate. We also develop a formal
   representation of the network of interactions between the suite of
   potential drivers and the suite of services, providing a framework to
   capture the complexity of this network and its embedded feedback loops.
   Increased consideration of the linkages and feedbacks between drivers
   and ecosystem services will be required to underpin robust management
   responses into the future.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},

Volume = {96},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Important findings from the second decade of the 21st century on the
   impact of environmental change on biological processes in the Antarctic
   were synthesised by 26 international experts. Ten key messages emerged
   that have stakeholder-relevance and/or a high impact for the scientific
   community. They address (i) altered biogeochemical cycles, (ii) ocean
   acidification, (iii) climate change hotspots, (iv) unexpected dynamism
   in seabed-dwelling populations, (v) spatial range shifts, (vi)
   adaptation and thermal resilience, (vii) sea ice related biological
   fluctuations, (viii) pollution, (ix) endangered terrestrial endemism and
   (x) the discovery of unknown habitats. Most Antarctic biotas are exposed
   to multiple stresses and considered vulnerable to environmental change
   due to narrow tolerance ranges, rapid change, projected circumpolar
   impacts, low potential for timely genetic adaptation, and migration
   barriers. Important ecosystem functions, such as primary production and
   energy transfer between trophic levels, have already changed, and
   biodiversity patterns have shifted. A confidence assessment of the
   degree of `scientific understanding' revealed an intermediate level for
   most of the more detailed sub-messages, indicating that process-oriented
   research has been successful in the past decade. Additional efforts are
   necessary, however, to achieve the level of robustness in scientific
   knowledge that is required to inform protection measures of the unique
   Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and their contributions to
   global biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Title = {Evaluating Antarctic marine protected area scenarios using a dynamic
   food web model},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {251},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas, especially when they are or include no-take
   zones, can support conservation objectives by creating an area where
   marine organisms are protected from human disturbances, particularly
   fishing. The coast of the Antarctic continent is the only habitat of the
   iconic Adelie penguin, whose main diet is Antarctic krill. Current
   threats to Adelie Penguins, other Antarctic krill predators and
   Antarctic krill itself include sea-ice loss as a result of climate
   change and krill fishing. We use a spatially and temporally dynamic food
   web model of the region surrounding the Western Antarctic Peninsula to
   evaluate the potential impacts of various marine protected area
   scenarios in the context of climate change. We examine the effects of
   sustained sea-ice loss on krill and seven monitored krill predators. We
   evaluate four marine protected area scenarios given two scenarios that
   describe future changes in sea ice and three scenarios that describe
   future changes in krill fishing effort. Our results indicate that
   establishing no-take zones where krill might aggregate in the future and
   where some krill predators forage could positively affect biomass
   accumulation of krill and the predators. No-take zones may be
   particularly important for enhancing the resilience of species that have
   recently experienced population decline and ensuring positive outcomes
   from establishing a marine protected area in the region. Our simulations
   suggest that establishing protected areas in the right locations can
   play an important role in mitigating the negative effects of climate
   change on iconic species that many people want to conserve.},

Title = {Climate-driven variability in Euphausia pacifica size distributions off
   northern California},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {188},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We analyzed an 11-year data set of length measurements for Euphausia
   pacifica, resolved by developmental stages ranging from early furcilia
   through adults, to characterize temporal variability in size
   distributions in relation to environmental and climate forcing in
   coastal waters of the northern California Current. Our analysis reveals
   that coastal size distributions of this linchpin species are related to
   temperature and chlorophyll a concentration, and indicate that warm
   climate events disrupt and suppress typical seasonal dynamics, resulting
   in persistent shifts towards populations dominated by smaller juveniles
   and adults. The 2014-16 marine heatwave (MHW) resulted in sharp and
   sustained transition in the size structure of E. pacifica off northern
   California; we captured numerous mature individuals smaller than any
   previously reported in the literature and larger size classes were
   conspicuously absent or rare when the MHW most strongly impacted coastal
   waters. Early life history stages exhibited a contrasting response,
   shifting instead towards larger size distributions during warm years.
   Advection appears to be the dominant mechanism driving rapid shifts in
   E. pacifica size structure off northern California, which implies
   alongshore and cross-shelf gradients in life history expression (e.g.,
   changes in size-at-maturation) related primarily to temperature.
   Variability in food availability (chlorophyll concentration) and
   physiological responses (e.g., changes in growth rates) likely
   contribute to seasonal variability, but appear insufficient to account
   for sharp, climate-driven transitions. Climate-driven shifts in
   individual and total biomass of this critical and dominant forage
   species have important ecological implications, particularly for growth
   and survival of species at higher trophic levels. Given that warm water
   events are likely to increase with climate change, the effects of the
   2014-16 MHW on E. pacifica in coastal waters may serve as a harbinger
   for future change. Detailed information on size structure of euphausiid
   populations is fundamental to understanding population responses to and
   ecosystem consequences of climatic and environmental forcing, and has
   been incorporated in assessments that support ecosystem-based approaches
   to fisheries management.},

   on the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery and krill-dependent
   predators in the Scotia Sea, explicitly addressing the displacement of
   fishing from closed areas. For both scenarios, we employed a minimally
   realistic, spatially explicit ecosystem model and considered three
   alternative redistributions of displaced fishing. We projected both MPAs
   to provide positive outcomes for many krill-dependent predators,
   especially when closed areas included at least 50-75\% of their foraging
   distributions. Further, differences between the scenarios suggest ways
   to improve seal and penguin protection in the Scotia Sea. MPA scenarios
   also projected increases in total fishery yields, but alongside risks of
   fishing in areas where relatively low krill densities could cause the
   fishery to suspend operations. The three alternatives for redistributing
   displaced fishing had little effect on benefits to predators, but did
   matter for the fishery, with greater differences in overall catch and
   risk of fishing in areas of low krill density when displaced fishing was
   redistributed evenly among the open areas. Collectively, results suggest
   a well-designed MPA in the Scotia Sea may protect krill-dependent
   predators, even with displaced fishing, and preclude further spatial
   management of the krill fishery outside the MPA. More broadly, outcomes
   denote the importance of delineating fishing and predator habitat,
   spatial scales, and the critical trade-offs inherent in MPA development.},
