Title = {The energetic cost of early reproductive development in juvenile
   Antarctic krill at the Western Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {The overwinter survival mechanisms of Antarctic krill, Euphausia
   superba, are poorly characterized, especially for juveniles. It has been
   suggested that juveniles adopt a mix of strategies characteristic of
   both larvae and adults. Like larvae, they may feed opportunistically
   throughout winter when food is available, and like adults they may be
   able to suppress their metabolism when food is scarce. In this study we
   look at the overwinter strategies of juvenile krill and how their
   reproductive development changes when energy input exceeds what is
   necessary for survival. We take a closer look at how the sexual
   maturation of juvenile krill progresses in response to different
   environmental conditions throughout the fall and winter. We exposed
   juvenile Antarctic krill to four different ``food environment
   scenarios{''}, supplementing them with various diets from May to
   September 2019 that were representative of environmental conditions that
   they may encounter in different regions of the Western Antarctic
   Peninsula during autumn and winter. Each month, we measured the
   physiology and condition of the krill, and assessed the reproductive
   development of females. We found that when female juvenile krill have
   greater energy reserves than what is needed to survive the winter, they
   will begin to sexually mature. Further, when there are sufficient levels
   of the fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid
   (DHA) and 16:4 (n-1), krill are likely to be in a more reproductive
   advanced stage. However, when lipids, EPA, DHA and 16:4 (n-1) are
   depleted throughout the winter, juvenile female krill lose their ability
   to develop reproductively. We also found that sexual development is an
   energy intensive process that requires high respiration rates in
   juvenile krill. Furthermore, when juvenile females expend energy
   maturing, their physiological condition declines. This trade-off between
   early reproductive development and condition in juvenile female krill
   has important implications for individual health and population
   fecundity. Gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms behind
   juvenile krill winter survival strategies and their consequences will
   allow us to predict how future change at the western Antarctic Peninsula
   may affect krill population dynamics, especially in light of a warming
   climate.},

Abstract = {The study aimed to investigate krill (Euphausia superba) and salp (Salpa
   thompsoni) populations in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean in
   January and February 2022. Samples were obtained to measure the
   abundance, biomass and distribution patterns of krill and salp. Sex
   differences and feeding habits of the Antarctic krill were determined.
   The dependence of the physiological state of the studied aquatic
   organisms on changes in environmental parameters was analyzed. Current
   data on the association of the dynamics of hydrometeorological
   parameters and processes with the distribution of chlorophyll a, krill,
   and salp were obtained. It was established that, at numerous stations,
   the biomass of salps prevailed over krill. The result indicates the
   replacement of the Antarctic krill populations by gelatinous
   zooplankton. The obtained results allow assessment of the biological
   resource potential in the studied region based on the analysis of the

Title = {The Role of Zooplankton Grazing and Nutrient Recycling for Global Ocean
   Biogeochemistry and Phytoplankton Phenology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Zooplankton plays a notable role in ocean biogeochemical cycles.
   However, it is often simulated as one generic group and top closure term
   in ocean biogeochemical models. This study presents the description of
   three zooplankton functional types (zPFTs, micro-, meso- and
   macrozooplankton) in the ocean biogeochemical model FESOM-REcoM. In the
   presented model, microzooplankton is a fast-growing herbivore group,
   mesozooplankton is another major consumer of phytoplankton, and
   macrozooplankton is a slow-growing group with a low temperature optimum.
   Meso- and macrozooplankton produce fast-sinking fecal pellets. With
   three zPFTs, the annual mean zooplankton biomass increases threefold to
   210 Tg C. The new food web structure leads to a 25\% increase in net
   primary production and a 10\% decrease in export production globally.
   Consequently, the export ratio decreases from 17\% to 12\% in the model.
   The description of three zPFTs reduces model mismatches with observed
   dissolved inorganic nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations in the South
   Pacific and the Arctic Ocean, respectively. Representation of three
   zPFTs also strongly affects phytoplankton phenology: Fast nutrient
   recycling by zooplankton sustains higher chlorophyll concentrations in
   summer and autumn. Additional zooplankton grazing delays the start of
   the phytoplankton bloom by 3 weeks and controls the magnitude of the
   bloom peak in the Southern Ocean. As a result, the system switches from
   a light-controlled Sverdrup system to a dilution-controlled Behrenfeld
   system. Overall, the results suggest that representation of multiple
   zPFTs is important to capture underlying processes that may shape the
   response of ecosystems and ecosystem services to on-going and future
   environmental change in model projections.},

Title = {Winter condition, physiology, and growth potential of juvenile Antarctic
   krill},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to understand the
   implications of climate change on Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba,
   because of their pivotal role in the Southern Ocean food web and in
   biogeochemical cycling. Winter is one of the least studied seasons in
   Antarctica and we have limited understanding about the strategies
   Antarctic krill use to survive the winter. In particular, data on the
   winter physiology and condition of juvenile Antarctic krill are severely
   lacking. From May to September (the austral autumn-winter) of 2019, we
   maintained juvenile Antarctic krill in large (1,330 L) aquarium tanks at
   Palmer Station, Antarctica and, at monthly time intervals, measured
   their physiology and condition. Each tank served as a ``food environment
   scenario{''}, representing possible food environments the krill may
   encounter during winter along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. We found
   that, unlike adults, juvenile krill maintain relatively high respiration
   rates through the winter and respond positively to increased food
   concentrations by increasing their ingestion rates. Unlike larval krill,
   juveniles use lipid stores accumulated during the summer and autumn to
   sustain themselves through periods of starvation in the winter. We used
   our empirically derived measurements of physiology and condition to
   estimate the energy budget and growth potential of juvenile krill during
   the winter. We found that, given their comparatively high respiration
   rates, small juvenile krill (20 mg dry weight) would need to encounter
   food at concentrations of similar to 0.15 mg C L-1 daily to avoid loss
   of body carbon. Without sufficient lipid reserves, this value increases
   to similar to 0.54 mg C L-1, daily. The health of juvenile krill in the
   wintertime is dependent on their ability to accumulate lipid stores in
   the summer and autumn and to find sufficient food during the winter.
   Changes in food availability to Antarctic krill throughout the year may
   become problematic to juvenile krill in the future. Understanding the
   variability in the winter energy budget of juvenile Antarctic krill will
   allow us to improve population models that make assumptions on seasonal
   growth patterns.},

Title = {Climate drivers of Southern Ocean phytoplankton community composition
   and potential impacts on higher trophic levels},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Southern Ocean phytoplankton production supports rich Antarctic marine
   ecosystems comprising copepods, krill, fish, seals, penguins, and
   whales. Anthropogenic climate change, however, is likely to drive
   rearrangements in phytoplankton community composition with potential
   ramifications for the whole ecosystem. In general, phytoplankton
   communities dominated by large phytoplankton, i.e., diatoms, yield
   shorter, more efficient food chains than ecosystems supported by small
   phytoplankton. Guided by a large ensemble of Earth system model
   simulations run under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5), we present
   hypotheses for how anthropogenic climate change may drive shifts in
   phytoplankton community structure in two regions of the Southern Ocean:
   the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) region and the sea ice zone
   (SIZ). Though both Southern Ocean regions experience warmer ocean
   temperatures and increased advective iron flux under 21st century
   climate warming, the model simulates a proliferation of diatoms at the
   expense of small phytoplankton in the ACC, while the opposite patterns
   are evident in the SIZ. The primary drivers of simulated diatom
   increases in the ACC region include warming, increased iron supply, and
   reduced light from increased cloudiness. In contrast, simulated
   reductions in ice cover yield greater light penetration in the SIZ,
   generating a phenological advance in the bloom accompanied by a shift to
   more small phytoplankton that effectively consume available iron; the
   result is an overall increase in net primary production, but a
   decreasing proportion of diatoms. Changes of this nature may promote
   more efficient trophic energy transfer via copepods or krill in the ACC
   region, while ecosystem transfer efficiency in the SIZ may decline as
   small phytoplankton grow in dominance, possibly impacting marine food
   webs sustaining Antarctic marine predators. Despite the simplistic
   ecosystem representation in our model, our results point to a potential
   shift in the relative success of contrasting phytoplankton ecological
   strategies in different regions of the Southern Ocean, with
   ramifications for higher trophic levels.},

Title = {Predicted changes in the distribution of Antarctic krill in the
   Cosmonaut Sea under future climate change scenarios},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are the key species of the
   ecological system in the Cosmonaut Sea. Long-term habitat alterations in
   krill due to climate change have been considered in recent decades.
   However, there is still a lack understanding about krill distribution.
   The MaxEnt model was used to forecast the suitable distribution area of
   krill for this study, which is based on data from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project in its sixth phase (CMIP6) in the near future
   and far future. A total of 145 occurrence points and 15 environmental
   factors were selected to build the MaxEnt model. The current suitable
   habitat regions for krill were mostly detected in the western and
   central regions of the Cosmonaut Sea, which accounted for 10.07\% of the
   total area. The most important environmental variables that influenced
   krill distribution were minimum surface solar radiation downward
   (ssrdmin), the mean temperature (tem) and the mean northward velocity
   (v). In the near future and far future, the suitable area of krill was
   seen to decline under all shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), with the
   smallest reduction under SSP1-2.6 and the greatest reduction under
   SSP5-8.5. The suitable area for krill dropped quicker from the near
   future to the far future than the present to the near future. Krill
   habitats were expected to shift to the poles. The tem continued to rise
   in the future under all SSP scenarios, particularly under the high
   radiative forcing scenario. The increase in water temperature is the
   main reason for the decrease in suitable areas for Antarctic krill. Our
   results show the future distribution of krill in the future and provide
   a reasonable reference for the ecological protection policy of the
   Cosmonaut Sea.},

Title = {Status, Change, and Futures of Zooplankton in the Southern Ocean},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {In the Southern Ocean, several zooplankton taxonomic groups,
   euphausiids, copepods, salps and pteropods, are notable because of their
   biomass and abundance and their roles in maintaining food webs and
   ecosystem structure and function, including the provision of globally
   important ecosystem services. These groups are consumers of microbes,
   primary and secondary producers, and are prey for fishes, cephalopods,
   seabirds, and marine mammals. In providing the link between microbes,
   primary production, and higher trophic levels these taxa influence
   energy flows, biological production and biomass, biogeochemical cycles,
   carbon flux and food web interactions thereby modulating the structure
   and functioning of ecosystems. Additionally, Antarctic krill (Euphausia
   superba) and various fish species are harvested by international
   fisheries. Global and local drivers of change are expected to affect the
   dynamics of key zooplankton species, which may have potentially profound
   and wide-ranging implications for Southern Ocean ecosystems and the
   services they provide. Here we assess the current understanding of the
   dominant metazoan zooplankton within the Southern Ocean, including
   Antarctic krill and other key euphausiid, copepod, salp and pteropod
   species. We provide a systematic overview of observed and potential
   future responses of these taxa to a changing Southern Ocean and the
   functional relationships by which drivers may impact them. To support
   future ecosystem assessments and conservation and management strategies,
   we also identify priorities for Southern Ocean zooplankton research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {101},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study examines the adaptability of a Southern Ocean predator, which
   is dependent on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), to potential
   changes in food availability. Muscle fatty acids (FAs) of the spiny
   icefish Chaenodraco wilsoni collected from three areas in the Bransfield
   Strait (BS), northern Antarctic Peninsula during February-April 2016
   give a good representation of their feeding variability. The
   compositions of 22:6n3 (DHA) and 20:5n3 (EPA) were both higher in the
   Transitional Zonal Water with Bellingshausen influence (TBW)-controlled
   C. wilsoni than in the Transitional Zonal Water with Weddell Sea
   influence (TWW)-controlled fish. This was positively correlated with
   photoadaptation and carbon sequestration in TBW-controlled
   phytoplankton. Results for the FAs 16:1n7, 16:0, DHA and EPA indicate
   the presence of dinoflagellates in all three areas, suggesting that
   during late summer and early fall, there is a seasonal phytoplankton
   succession, where small phytoplankton become dominant, in the BS. In
   addition, the compositions of some long-chain FAs (>20, such as 20:0,
   20:1, 22:0 and 22:1n9) and n-ary sumation 18 indicated that the food
   chain based on flagellates and copepods was more apparent in
   TWW-controlled C. wilsoni, especially the effect of El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) on the variation of prey communities in
   TWW-controlled areas. FA markers such as SFA/(PUFA+MUFA), n-ary sumation
   15 + n-ary sumation 17 and ARA were more pronounced in TWW-controlled C.
   wilsoni, indicating a more strongly carnivorous and benthic food source.
   In the TBW-TWW confluence, the complex hydrological structure, including
   the presence of a large number of mesoscale eddies, allows rich
   nutrients and krill larvae to remain in it, providing a rich food source
   for the C. wilsoni. Overall, the FA data of this study show that the
   diet of C. wilsoni varies in different marine environments, aiding their
   survivability at the face of climate change.},

Title = {Using seabird and whale distribution models to estimate spatial
   consumption of krill to inform fishery management},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ecosystem dynamics at the northwest Antarctic Peninsula are driven by
   interactions between physical and biological processes. For example,
   baleen whale populations are recovering from commercial harvesting
   against the backdrop of rapid climate change, including reduced sea ice
   extent and changing ecosystem composition. Concurrently, the commercial
   harvesting of Antarctic krill is increasing, with the potential to
   increase the likelihood for competition with and between krill predators
   and the fishery. However, understanding the ecology, abundance, and
   spatial distribution of krill predators is often limited, outdated, or
   at spatial scales that do not match those desired for effective
   fisheries management. We update current knowledge of predator dependence
   on krill by integrating telemetry-based data, at-sea observational
   surveys, estimates of predator abundance, and physiological data to
   estimate the spatial distribution of krill consumption during the
   austral summer by three species of Pygoscelis penguin, 11 species of
   flying seabirds, one species of pinniped, and two species of baleen
   whale. Our models show that the majority of important areas for krill
   predator foraging are close to penguin breeding colonies in nearshore
   areas where humpback whales also regularly feed, and along the
   shelf-break, though we caution that not all known krill predators are
   included in these analyses. We show that krill consumption is highly
   variable across the region, and often concentrated at fine spatial
   scales, emphasizing the need for the management of the local krill
   fishery at relevant temporal and spatial scales. We also note that krill
   consumption by recovering populations of krill predators provides
   further evidence in support of the krill surplus hypothesis, and
   highlight that despite less than comprehensive data, cetaceans are
   likely to consume a significant proportion of the krill consumed by
   natural predators but are not currently considered directly in the
   management of the krill fishery. If management of the krill fishery is
   to be precautionary and operate in a way that minimizes the risks to
   krill predator populations, it will be necessary in future analyses, to
   include up-to-date and precise abundance and consumption estimates for
   pack-ice seals, finfish, squid, and other baleen whale species not
   currently considered.},

Title = {Using habitat models for chinstrap penguins, Pygoscelis antarctica, to
   inform marine spatial management around the South Sandwich Islands
   during the penguin breeding season},
Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {199},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {If not carefully managed, harvesting of Antarctic krill risks disturbing
   the ecological balance of many Antarctic and sub-Antarctic sites where
   krill-dependent predators feed. One of the least disturbed sites
   anywhere within the Southern Ocean and one where krill fishing has so
   far been virtually non-existent is the South Sandwich Islands volcanic
   archipelago. Some of the main krill predators breeding at the South
   Sandwich Islands are penguins, with five species breeding on the
   islands, the dominant species of which is the chinstrap penguin. In this
   paper we report on the results of ARGOS PTT deployments during the
   chinstrap penguin chick-rearing period, using the recorded foraging
   trips to develop habitat models. Foraging habitats used by chinstrap
   penguins during this period were best characterised by distance from the
   colony and sea surface temperature and, using these two covariates, we
   predicted the chick-rearing foraging habitat use around all islands. We
   show that the provisions of the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands
   Marine Protected Area ensure that chinstrap penguins, and other
   krill-dependent predators with similar foraging ranges, likely have
   robust protection during the summer. During the winter, when krill
   predators are likely to forage further offshore, seasonal sea ice
   provides a physical barrier to exclude the fishery, again ensuring the
   islands??? unique biodiversity receives strong protection. However, to
   the north of the marginal sea ice zone, competition between krill
   predators and the fishery could exist if the fishery were ever to
   explore new locations for resource extraction. We make a number of
   conclusions, including the need for winter tracking data to inform
   future management options.},

Title = {Individual and joint estimation of humpback whale migratory patterns and
   their environmental drivers in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) perform seasonal migrations
   from high latitude feeding grounds to low latitude breeding and calving
   grounds. Feeding grounds at polar regions are currently experiencing
   major ecosystem modifications, therefore, quantitatively assessing
   species responses to habitat characteristics is crucial for
   understanding how whales might respond to such modifications. We
   analyzed satellite telemetry data from 22 individual humpback whales in
   the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWA). Tagging effort was divided in two
   periods, 2003-2012 and 2016-2019. Correlations between whale's movement
   parameters and environmental variables were used as proxy for inferring
   behavioral responses to environmental variation. Two versions of a
   covariate-driven continuous-time correlated random-walk state-space
   model, were fitted to the data: i) Population-level models (P-models),
   which assess correlation parameters pooling data across all individuals
   or groups, and ii) individual-level models (I-models), fitted
   independently for each tagged whale. Area of Restricted Search behavior
   (slower and less directionally persistent movement, ARS) was
   concentrated at cold waters south of the Polar Front (similar to 50
   degrees S). The best model showed that ARS was expected to occur in
   coastal areas and over ridges and seamounts. Ice coverage during August
   of each year was a consistent predictor of ARS across models. Wind
   stress curl and sea surface temperature anomalies were also correlated
   with movement parameters but elicited larger inter-individual variation.
   I-models were consistent with P-models' predictions for the case of
   females accompanied by calves (mothers), while males and those of
   undetermined sex (males +) presented more variability as a group.
   Spatial predictions of humpback whale behavioral responses showed that
   feeding grounds for this population are concentrated in the complex
   system of islands, ridges, and rises of the Scotia Sea and the northern
   Weddell Ridge. More southernly incursions were observed in recent years,
   suggesting a potential response to increased temperature and large ice
   coverage reduction observed in the late 2010s. Although, small sample
   size and differences in tracking duration precluded appropriately
   testing predictions for such a distributional shift, our modelling
   framework showed the efficiency of borrowing statistical strength during
   data pooling, while pinpointing where more complexity should be added in
   the future as additional data become available.},

Abstract = {Antarctic krill is the key species of ecological system in the Amundsen
   Sea. At present, the suitable distribution is unobtainable by scientific
   surveys or data from the fishery. In this paper, the maximum entropy
   algorithm (Maxent) was used to obtain the potential distribution of
   adult Antarctic krill in order to provide useful information and
   reasonable reference for the policy on protecting potential krill
   habitats around the Amundsen Sea. Occurrence points and 17 environmental
   variables were used to simulate the distributions. Results show that the
   high and moderate suitable habitats lie between 65 degrees S and 72
   degrees S in the Amundsen Sea. The high suitable habitat accounts for
   8.1\% of the total area of the Amundsen Sea. The sea ice persistence
   (ICE), total phytoplankton (PHYC), and the minimum value of dissolved
   iron (Fe\_min) are the three dominant contributors to the model. Results
   from the response curves show that Antarctic krill preferred habitats
   with ICE of 0.42-0.93, PHYC of 2.48-2.77 mmol/m(3) and Fe\_min of
   (7.10x10(-5))-(9.45x10(-5)) mmol/m(3). Positive trends existed in the
   PHYC of the high and moderate suitable habitat, and a positive trend
   existed in the Fe\_min of moderate suitable habitat. However, the
   probability of presence of Antarctic krill will decrease if the increase
   of the PHYC and Fe\_min continues.},

Abstract = {This study was performed to aid the management of the fishery for
   Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Krill are an important component of
   the Antarctic marine ecosystem, providing a key food source for many
   marine predators. Additionally, krill are the target of the largest
   commercial fishery in the Southern Ocean, for which annual catches have
   been increasing and concentrating in recent years. The krill fishery is
   managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
   Living Resources (CCAMLR), which has endorsed a new management framework
   that requires information about the spatial distribution and biomass of
   krill. Here, we use krill density estimates from acoustic surveys and a
   GAMM framework to model habitat properties associated with high krill
   biomass during summer and winter in the northern Antarctic Peninsula
   region, an area important to the commercial fishery. Our models show
   elevated krill density associated with the shelf break, increased sea
   surface temperature, moderate chlorophyll-a concentration and increased
   salinity. During winter, our models show associations with shallow
   waters (< 1500 m) with low sea-ice concentration, medium sea-level
   anomaly and medium current speed. Our models predict temporal averages
   of the distribution and density of krill, which can be used to aid
   CCAMLR's revised ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Our models
   have the potential to help in the spatial and temporal design of future
   acoustic surveys that would preclude the need for modelled
   extrapolations. We highlight that the ecosystem approach to fisheries
   management of krill critically depends upon such field observations at
   relevant spatial and temporal scales.},

Abstract = {Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are showing strong recovery
   from commercial whaling in the western South Atlantic. In this region,
   humpback whales migrate annually from their winter breeding grounds off
   the coast of Brazil to their summer feeding grounds near to the Polar
   Front, an area that includes the waters of South Georgia and the South
   Sandwich Islands (SGSSI). This latter region includes a Marine Protected
   Area (MPA), which has been developed to ensure sustainable management of
   fisheries, and protection of foraging predators. To date, management
   measures within the MPA have primarily been concerned with foraging
   predators that rely upon Antarctic krill, including for a number of
   previously over-exploited species. With humpback whales increasing in
   the western South Atlantic, understandingnderstanding their
   spatiotemporal distribution within the MPA is important as it will help
   inform management particularly in respect of interactions between
   humpback whales and the regional fishery for Antarctic krill. Here we
   develop habitat models from the distribution and movement patterns of 16
   individuals at their high-latitude feeding grounds, south of 50 degrees
   S. We show that whale habitat use varies throughout the foraging period.
   Upon reaching their feeding ground, whales use the area to the east of
   the South Sandwich Islands, moving westward into the centre of the
   Scotia Arc and towards South Georgia during the high summer, and then
   expanding back towards the east in the winter. Based on these findings,
   we discuss the implications for the future, including necessary research
   required for underpinning management.},

Title = {Mercury biomagnification in an Antarctic food web of the Antarctic
   Peninsula},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {304},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Under the climate change context, warming Southern Ocean waters may
   allow mercury (Hg) to become more bioavailable to the Antarctic marine
   food web (i.e., ice-stored Hg release and higher methylation rates by
   mi-croorganisms), whose biomagnification processes are poorly
   documented. Biomagnification of Hg in the food web of the Antarctic
   Peninsula, one of the world's fastest-warming regions, was examined
   using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope
   ratios for estimating feeding habitat and trophic levels, respectively.
   The stable isotope signatures and total Hg (T-Hg) concentrations were
   measured in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and several Antarctic
   predator species, including seabirds (gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua,
   chinstrap penguins Pygoscelis antarcticus, brown skuas Stercorarius
   antarcticus, kelp gulls Larus dominicanus, southern giant petrels
   Macronectes giganteus) and marine mammals (southern elephant seals
   Mirounga leonina). Significant differences in delta C-13 values among
   species were noted with a great overlap between seabird species and M.
   leonina. As expected, significant differences in delta N-15 values among
   species were found due to interspecific variations in diet-related to
   their trophic position within the marine food web. The lowest Hg
   concentrations were registered in E. superba (0.007 +/- 0.008 mu g
   g(-1)) and the highest values in M. giganteus (12.090 +/- 14.177 mu g
   g(-1)). Additionally, a significant positive relationship was found
   between Hg concentrations and trophic levels (reflected by delta N-15
   values), biomagnifying nearly 2 times its concentrations at each level.
   Our results support that trophic interaction is the major pathway for Hg
   biomagnification in Southern Ocean ecosystems and warn about an increase
   in the effects of Hg on long-lived (and high trophic level) Antarctic
   predators under climate change in the future.},

Title = {Summer sea-ice variability on the Antarctic margin during the last

Abstract = {Antarctic sea ice is a critical component of the climate system
   affecting a range of physical and biogeochemical feedbacks and
   supporting unique ecosystems. During the last glacial stage, Antarctic
   sea ice was more extensive than today, but uncertainties in geological
   (marine sediments), glaciological (ice core), and climate model
   reconstructions of past sea-ice extent continue to limit our
   understanding of its role in the Earth system. Here, we present a novel
   archive of past sea-ice environments from regurgitated stomach oils of
   snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) preserved at nesting sites in Dronning
   Maud Land, Antarctica. We show that by combining information from fatty
   acid distributions and their stable carbon isotope ratios with
   measurements of bulk carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and trace metal
   data, it is possible to reconstruct changing snow petrel diet within
   Marine Isotope Stage 2 (ca. 24.3-30.3 cal kyr BP). We show that, as
   today, a mixed diet of krill and fish characterizes much of the record.
   However, between 27.4 and 28.7 cal kyr BP signals of krill almost
   disappear. By linking dietary signals in the stomach-oil deposits to
   modern feeding habits and foraging ranges, we infer the use by snow
   petrels of open-water habitats ({''}polynyas{''}) in the sea ice during
   our interval of study. The periods when consumption of krill was reduced
   are interpreted to correspond to the opening of polynyas over the
   continental shelf, which became the preferred foraging habitat. Our
   results show that extensive, thick, and multiyear sea ice was not always
   present close to the continent during the last glacial stage and
   highlight the potential of stomach-oil deposits as a palaeoenvironmental
   archive of Southern Ocean conditions.},

Title = {Modelling the effects of food limitation and temperature on the growth
   and reproduction of the krill Nyctiphanes australis},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {268},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {The krill Nyctiphanes australis is the most abundant and ecologically
   important euphausiid in southern Australia and New Zealand coastal and
   shelf waters. The species lives in coastal environments which are
   currently susceptible to shifts in temperature and productivity. Due to
   its abundance, it sustains many inshore fisheries and, for this reason,
   determining the potential outcome of future changes in sea temperature
   and productivity for Nyctiphanes is important. The temperature-and
   food-dependence of growth and reproduction of Nyctiphanes species can be
   made through Dynamic Energy Budget models (DEB), developed here to
   quantify how temperature and food availability affects growth,
   fecundity, egg size, and the energetic content of the eggs throughout
   the krill life-span. The DEB model predictions are in good agreement
   with measured life-history traits for the species and show that krill
   grows slower during winter while females do not always reach sexual
   maturity when temperatures are below 8 C and food levels are low. We
   found that higher temperatures and low food levels decrease the
   energetic content and diameter of the eggs by similar to 20\%, affecting
   the length and age at which N. australis commence reproduction. Under
   current scenarios of future ocean warming, these results indicate that
   populations of N. australis are likely to decline, with potential
   knock-on effects on coastal marine ecosystems and inshore fisheries.},

Abstract = {To understand the environmental factors affecting the density of
   foraging seabirds across the cold-water belt in the southwestern Okhotsk
   Sea, we conducted a 1-day (180-km transect length) shipboard seabird
   survey off the northeastern coast of Hokkaido during summer in 2019,
   along with acoustic observations of potential prey (zooplankton and
   fish) biomass, thermosalinograph measurements, and CTD observations.
   Planktivorous short-tailed shearwaters Ardenna tenuirostris (66\% of
   total seabirds) and piscivorous rhinoceros auklets Cerorhinca monocerata
   (28\%) were predominant, but foraged in contrasting habitats. A large
   foraging flock of shearwaters was observed in the cold-water belt zone,
   including its front with coastal Soya Warm Current Water and the
   offshore Fresh Surface Okhotsk Sea Water, where surface chlorophyll a
   concentrations were the highest but not related to their prey
   (zooplankton) biomass at any spatial scale between 4.6 and 9.2 km. In
   contrast, the density of auklets was high in the coastal Soya Warm
   Current Water, where the acoustically determined fish biomass was large,
   and showed a positive relationship with the fish biomass especially in
   the lower layer (29-104 m depth) at any spatial scale. This
   species-specific difference in response to prey biomass might be related
   to prey-searching behaviors; i.e., rhinoceros auklets search prey
   underwater visually, but short-tailed shearwater can use both visual and
   olfactory cues to locate zooplankton patches from the air.},

Title = {Large mesopelagic fish biomass in the Southern Ocean resolved by

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {289},

Month = {JAN 26},
Abstract = {The oceanic mesopelagic zone, 200-1000 m below sea level, holds abundant
   small fishes that play central roles in ecosystem function. Global
   mesopelagic fish biomass estimates are increasingly derived using active
   acoustics, where echosounder-generated signals are emitted, reflected by
   pelagic organisms and detected by transducers on vessels. Previous
   studies have interpreted a ubiquitous decline in acoustic reflectance
   towards the Antarctic continent as a reduction in mesopelagic fish
   biomass. Here, we use empirical data to estimate species-specific
   acoustic target strength for the dominant mesopelagic fish of the Scotia
   Sea in the Southern Ocean. We use these data, alongside estimates of
   fish relative abundance from net surveys, to interpret signals received
   in acoustic surveys and calculate mesopelagic biomass of the broader
   Southern Ocean. We estimate the Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish biomass
   to be approximately 274 million tonnes if Antarctic krill contribute to
   the acoustic signal, or 570 million tonnes if mesopelagic fish alone are
   responsible. These quantities are approximately 1.8 and 3.8 times
   greater than previous net-based biomass estimates. We also show a peak
   in fish biomass towards the seasonal ice-edge, corresponding to the
   preferred feeding grounds of penguins and seals, which may be at risk
   under future climate change scenarios. Our study provides new insights
   into the abundance and distributions of ecologically significant
   mesopelagic fish stocks across the Southern Ocean ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Primary production in the Southern Ocean is dominated by diatom-rich
   phytoplankton assemblages, whose individual physiological
   characteristics and community composition are strongly shaped by the
   environment, yet knowledge on how diatoms allocate cellular energy in
   response to ocean acidification (OA) is limited. Understanding such
   changes in allocation is integral to determining the nutritional quality
   of diatoms and the subsequent impacts on the trophic transfer of energy
   and nutrients. Using synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared
   microspectroscopy, we analysed the macromolecular content of selected
   individual diatom taxa from a natural Antarctic phytoplankton community
   exposed to a gradient of fCO(2) levels (288-1263 mu atm). Strong
   species-specific differences in macromolecular partitioning were
   observed under OA. Large taxa showed preferential energy allocation
   towards proteins, while smaller taxa increased both lipid and protein
   stores at high fCO(2). If these changes are representative of future
   Antarctic diatom physiology, we may expect a shift away from lipid-rich
   large diatoms towards a community dominated by smaller taxa, but with
   higher lipid and protein stores than their present-day contemporaries, a
   response that could have cascading effects on food web dynamics in the
   Antarctic marine ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Accumulation of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in Antarctic krill
   (Euphausia superba), a keystone species in the Southern Ocean, is
   potentially harmful to the Antarctic ecosystem and human health. In the
   current study, we collected E. superba specimens (including muscle and
   carapace tissues) from Bransfield Strait in northern Antarctic Peninsula
   and South Georgia to analyze the profile, influencing factors and
   mechanisms of OCPs bioaccumulation in them. Results indicated that the
   biological traits (813C, 815N and lipid contents) of krill were
   significantly affected by habitat. There may exist growth dilution of
   OCPs in Antarctic krill and no fresh OCPs input in Antarctica, except
   for endosulfan I. Based on lipid-normalized concentrations, no
   significant differences were observed between the two regions at most
   sampling sites. However, OCP levels showed tissue and sex dependence.
   Boosted regression trees (BRTs) and partial least squares structural
   equation models (PLS-SEMs) were built to better investigate the main
   factors affecting the bioaccumulation of OCPs. Lipid content, negatively
   correlated with OCP levels, was the main factor. In vitro silicon
   modeling indicated that CYP3A4 metabolism capacity in krill contributed
   to the OCP residues except for endosulfan I. The results of this study
   expand current knowledge of OCPs in Antarctic marine biota, as well as
   their influencing factors and potential mechanisms.},

Title = {Dynamic Species Distribution Models in the Marine Realm: Predicting
   Year-Round Habitat Suitability of Baleen Whales in the Southern Ocean},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {08},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) relate species information to
   environmental conditions to predict potential species distributions. The
   majority of SDMs are static, relating species presence information to
   long-term average environmental conditions. The resulting temporal
   mismatch between species information and environmental conditions can
   increase model inference's uncertainty. For SDMs to capture the dynamic
   species-environment relationships and predict near-real-time habitat
   suitability, species information needs to be spatiotemporally matched
   with environmental conditions contemporaneous to the species' presence
   (dynamic SDMs). Implementing dynamic SDMs in the marine realm is highly
   challenging, particularly due to species and environmental data paucity
   and spatiotemporally biases. Here, we implemented presence-only dynamic
   SDMs for four migratory baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean (SO):
   Antarctic minke, Antarctic blue, fin, and humpback whales. Sightings
   were spatiotemporally matched with their respective daily environmental
   predictors. Background information was sampled daily to describe the
   dynamic environmental conditions in the highly dynamic SO. We corrected
   for spatial sampling bias by sampling background information respective
   to the seasonal research efforts. Independent model evaluation was
   performed on spatial and temporal cross-validation. We predicted the
   circumantarctic year-round habitat suitability of each species. Daily
   predictions were also summarized into bi-weekly and monthly habitat
   suitability. We identified important predictors and species suitability
   responses to environmental changes. Our results support the propitious
   use of dynamic SDMs to fill species information gaps and improve
   conservation planning strategies. Near-real-time predictions can be used
   for dynamic ocean management, e.g., to examine the overlap between
   habitat suitability and human activities. Nevertheless, the inevitable
   spatiotemporal biases in sighting data from the SO call for the need for
   improving sampling effort in the SO and using alternative data sources
   (e.g., passive acoustic monitoring) in future SDMs. We further discuss
   challenges of calibrating dynamic SDMs on baleen whale species in the
   SO, with a particular focus on spatiotemporal sampling bias issues and
   how background information should be sampled in presence-only dynamic
   SDMs. We also highlight the need to integrate visual and acoustic data
   in future SDMs on baleen whales for better coverage of environmental
   conditions suitable for the species and avoid constraints of using
   either data type alone.},

Title = {Stepping stones towards Antarctica: Switch to southern spawning grounds
   explains an abrupt range shift in krill},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1359-1375},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Poleward range shifts are a global-scale response to warming, but these
   vary greatly among taxa and are hard to predict for individual species,
   localized regions or over shorter (years to decadal) timescales. Moving
   poleward might be easier in the Arctic than in the Southern Ocean, where
   evidence for range shifts is sparse and contradictory. Here, we compiled
   a database of larval Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba and, together
   with an adult database, it showed how their range shift is out of step
   with the pace of warming. During a 70-year period of rapid warming
   (1920s-1990s), distribution centres of both larvae and adults in the SW
   Atlantic sector remained fixed, despite warming by 0.5-1.0 degrees C and
   losing sea ice. This was followed by a hiatus in surface warming and ice
   loss, yet during this period the distributions of krill life stages
   shifted greatly, by similar to 1000 km, to the south-west. Understanding
   the mechanism of such step changes is essential, since they herald
   system reorganizations that are hard to predict with current modelling
   approaches. We propose that the abrupt shift was driven by climatic
   controls acting on localized recruitment hotspots, superimposed on
   thermal niche conservatism. During the warming hiatus, the Southern
   Annular Mode index continued to become increasingly positive and, likely
   through reduced feeding success for larvae, this led to a precipitous
   decline in recruitment from the main reproduction hotspot along the
   southern Scotia Arc. This cut replenishment to the northern portion of
   the krill stock, as evidenced by declining density and swarm frequency.
   Concomitantly, a new, southern reproduction area developed after the
   1990s, reinforcing the range shift despite the lack of surface warming.
   New spawning hotspots may provide the stepping stones needed for range
   shifts into polar regions, so planning of climate-ready marine protected
   areas should include these key areas of future habitat.},

Title = {The ecosystem approach to management of the Antarctic krill fishery-the
   `devils are in the detail' at small spatial and temporal scales},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {225},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Fishery demand for Antarctic krill is increasing, and projected to
   continue increasing into the future. Krill has the potential to
   contribute approximately 10\% to all future marine landings, adding
   significantly to global food security. However, the fishery is
   effectively data-limited so is currently managed using precautionary
   assess-ments that relate to large spatial and temporal scales that
   preclude the need for fine-scale ecological data. To respond to recent
   changes in fishery operation and to mitigate possible ecological
   impacts, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
   Resources (CCAMLR) plans to revise its management strategy so that it
   takes into account ecosystem operation at smaller spatial and temporal
   scales, such as those relevant to krill-dependent predators. Here, we
   consider how catches in coastal areas potentially present challenges for
   these predators, where cumulative catches over the fishing season can
   sometimes be greater than local consumption by predators, and sometimes
   greater than the standing stock of krill within an area because of krill
   transport and replenishment by ocean currents. Protecting feeding areas
   used by land-based predators such as penguins and seals, whilst also
   offering a high level of protection for pelagic predators such as some
   species of fish and recovering populations of cetaceans, will require
   innovative solutions. We highlight critical ecological research needed
   to reduce management uncertainty. This is important as we demonstrate
   that krill consumption by predators in near-shore coastal habitats
   relies absolutely upon krill movement and oceanographic transport. We
   also highlight the need to improve understanding about krill behaviour,
   especially in relation to observed seasonal changes in krill biomass.
   Finally, we highlight that without up-to-date data about changes in
   krill, krill-dependent predator populations and their oceanographic
   environ-ment, management will remain challenging in the context of
   increasing fishing pressure, recovering populations of marine mammals
   and a changing climate.},

Abstract = {Detailed knowledge of habitat use by marine megafauna is critical to
   understand their ecological roles and for the adequate management of
   marine resources. Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) inhabiting
   the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean prey largely on Antarctic
   krill (Euphausia superba) and play a central role in managing the krill
   fishery. Here, we assessed the demographic structure of three
   post-mating, early moult male haul-outs in the South Shetland Islands in
   early March and calculated the relative contribution of juveniles (1-4
   years old) and sub-adult males (5-6 years) to the population remaining
   in maritime Antarctica after the breeding season. We also satellite
   tagged 11 juvenile males and four sub-adult males to analyze their
   movements and develop a species distribution model including both age
   classes. Our results highlighted the dominance of young individuals in
   the male population, revealed that they do not behave as central place
   foragers and identified key environmental drivers that affected their
   distribution at-sea throughout winter. Predicted potential foraging
   habitat overlapped highly with the known distribution of Antarctic
   krill, and identified the waters off the western Antarctic Peninsula and
   the Scotia Sea as the core of the distribution area of juvenile and
   sub-adult male Antarctic fur seals in winter. This pattern is similar to
   that of adult males but totally different from that of adult females, as
   the latter overwinter in areas at latitude 45-55 degrees S. This
   segregation has implications for the ecology and management of the krill
   fishery.},

Title = {An Integrated, Size-Structured Stock Assessment of Antarctic Krill,
   Euphausia superba},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery is the largest fishery
   in the Southern Ocean, and it has been operating for over 45 years. In
   the past decade, the spatial distribution of the krill fishery has
   focused on the Bransfield Strait off the Antarctic Peninsula (subarea
   48.1). However, the high fishing effort and climate change have placed
   great pressure on krill resources in this region, and conservation
   concerns have been raised. Because aging krill is difficult and
   uncertain, we developed an integrated size-structured model to estimate
   the fishing mortality, recruitment and spawning biomass of krill. The
   results indicated that in 1992-2011, the average spawning biomass of
   krill ranged from 1.14 x 10(6) to 1.45 x 10(6) tons, the estimated
   biomass of the maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) ranged from 3.96 x 10(5)
   to 4.90 x 10(5) tons and the estimated average recruitment ranged from
   2.3 x 10(12) to 5.03 x 10(12) individuals in the research area. We
   explored the effect of different data weighting schemes for the length
   data on the assessment output. However, our estimates also have
   uncertainties. In addition, an attempt was made to analyze the
   correlation between model-estimated recruitment and mature biomass with
   climate change. Future stock assessments of krill resources should be
   comprehensive and multimethod, and the management of krill resources
   should be based on science that considers the demand of fishing
   communities and ecosystem protection.},

Abstract = {Whales contribute to marine ecosystem functioning, and they may play a
   role in mitigating climate change and supporting the Antarctic krill
   (Euphausia superba) population, a keystone prey species that sustains
   the entire Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystem. By analyzing a five-decade
   (1971-2017) data series of individual southern right whales (SRWs;
   Eubalaena australis) photo-identified at Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, we
   found a marked increase in whale mortality rates following El Nino
   events. By modeling how the population responds to changes in the
   frequency and intensity of El Nino events, we found that such events are
   likely to impede SRW population recovery and could even cause population
   decline. Such outcomes have the potential to disrupt food-web
   interactions in the SO, weakening that ecosystem's contribution to the
   mitigation of climate change at a global scale.},

Title = {Ice matters: Life-history strategies of two Antarctic seals dictate
   climate change eventualities in the Weddell Sea},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {23},
Pages = {6252-6262},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are
   not uniform and ice-obligate species with dissimilar life-history
   characteristics will likely respond differently to their changing
   ecosystems. We use a unique data set of Weddell Leptonychotes weddellii
   and crabeater seals' (CESs) Lobodon carcinophaga breeding season
   distribution in the Weddell Sea, determined from satellite imagery. We
   contrast the theoretical climate impacts on both ice-obligate predators
   who differ in life-history characteristics: CESs are highly specialized
   Antarctic krill Euphausia superba predators and breed in the seasonal
   pack ice; Weddell seals (WESs) are generalist predators and breed on
   comparatively stable fast ice. We used presence-absence data and a suite
   of remotely sensed environmental variables to build habitat models. Each
   of the environmental predictors is multiplied by a `climate change
   score' based on known responses to climate change to create a `change
   importance product'. Results show CESs are more sensitive to climate
   change than WESs. Crabeater seals prefer to breed close to krill, and
   the compounding effects of changing sea ice concentrations and sea
   surface temperatures, the proximity to krill and abundance of stable
   breeding ice, can influence their post-breeding foraging success and
   ultimately their future breeding success. But in contrast to the Ross
   Sea, here WESs prefer to breed closer to larger colonies of emperor
   penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). This suggests that the Weddell Sea may
   currently be prey-abundant, allowing the only two air-breathing
   Antarctic silverfish predators (Pleuragramma antarctica) (WESs and
   emperor penguins) to breed closer to each other. This is the first
   basin-scale, region-specific comparison of breeding season habitat in
   these two key Antarctic predators based on real-world data to compare
   climate change responses. This work shows that broad-brush, basin-scale
   approaches to understanding species-specific responses to climate change
   are not always appropriate, and regional models are needed-especially
   when designing marine protected areas.},

Title = {Parasites of Three Closely Related Antarctic Fish Species (Teleostei:

Journal = {ACTA PARASITOLOGICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {218-232},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background Studies of parasite communities and patterns in the Antarctic
   are an important knowledge base with the potential to track shifts in
   ecological relations and study the effects of climate change on
   host-parasite systems. Endemic Nototheniinae is the dominant fish group
   found in Antarctic marine habitats. Through their intermediate position
   within the food web, Nototheniinae link lower to higher trophic levels
   and thereby also form an important component of parasite life cycles.
   The study was set out to gain insight into the parasite fauna of
   Nototheniops larseni, N. nudifrons and Lepidonotothen squamifrons
   (Nototheniinae) from Elephant Island (Antarctica). Methods Sampling was
   conducted at three locations around Elephant Island during the
   ANT-XXVIII/4 expedition of the research vessel Polarstern. The parasite
   fauna of three Nototheniine species was analysed, and findings were
   compared to previous parasitological and ecological research collated
   from a literature review. Results All host species shared the parasites
   Neolebouria antarctica (Digenea), Corynosoma bullosum (Acanthocephala)
   and Pseudoterranova decipiens E (Nematoda). Other parasite taxa were
   exclusive to one host species in this study. Nototheniops nudifrons was
   infected by Ascarophis nototheniae (Nematoda), occasional infections of
   N. larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi (Acanthocephala) and L.
   squamifrons with Elytrophalloides oatesi (Digenea) and larval
   tetraphyllidean Cestoda were detected. Conclusion All examined fish
   species' parasites were predominantly euryxenous regarding their fish
   hosts. The infection of Lepidonotothen squamifrons with Lepidapedon
   garrardi (Digenea) and Nototheniops larseni with Echinorhynchus
   petrotschenkoi represent new host records. Despite the challenges and
   limited opportunities for fishing in remote areas, future studies should
   continue sampling on a more regular basis and include a larger number of
   fish species and sampling sites within different habitats.},

Title = {Salp fecal pellets release more bioavailable iron to Southern Ocean

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {13},

Month = {JUL 12},
Abstract = {Over the last decades, it has been reported that the habitat of the
   Southern Ocean (SO) key species Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has
   contracted to high latitudes, putatively due to reduced winter sea ice
   coverage, while salps as Salpa thompsoni have extended their dispersal
   to the former krill habitats. To date, the potential implications of
   this population shift on the biogeochemical cycling of the limiting
   micronutrient iron (Fe) and its bioavailability to SO phytoplankton has
   never been tested. Based on uptake of fecal pellet (FP)released Fe by SO
   phytoplankton, this study highlights how efficiently krill and salps
   recycle Fe. To test this, we collected FPs of natural populations of
   salps and krill, added them to the same SO phytoplankton community,
   andmeasured the community's Fe uptake rates. Our results reveal that
   both FP additions yielded similar dissolved iron concentrations in the
   seawater. Per FP carbon added to the seawater, 4.8 +/- 1.5 times more Fe
   was taken up by the same phytoplankton community from salp FP than from
   krill FP, suggesting that salp FP increased the Fe bioavailability,
   possibly through the release of ligands. With respect to the ongoing
   shift from krill to salps, the potential for carbon fixation of the
   Fe-limited SO could be strengthened in the future, representing a
   negative feedback to climate change.},

Title = {Sympatry and resource partitioning between the largest krill consumers
   around the Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {669},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Understanding how closely related, sympatric species distribute
   themselves relative to their environment is critical to understanding
   ecosystem structure and function and predicting effects of environmental
   variation. The Antarctic Peninsula supports high densities of krill and
   krill consumers; however, the region is warming rapidly, with unknown
   consequences. Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and Antarctic minke
   whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis are the largest krill consumers here,
   yet key data gaps remain about their distribution, behavior, and
   interactions and how these will be impacted by changing conditions.
   Using satellite telemetry and novel spatial point-process modeling
   techniques, we quantified habitat use of each species relative to
   dynamic environmental variables and determined overlap in core habitat
   areas during summer months when sea ice is at a minimum. We found that
   humpback whales ranged broadly over continental shelf waters, utilizing
   nearshore bays, while minke whales restricted their movements to
   sheltered bays and areas where ice is present. This presents a scenario
   where minke whale core habitat overlaps substantially with the broader
   home ranges of humpback whales. While there is no indication that prey
   is limiting in this ecosystem, increased overlap between these species
   may arise as climate-driven changes that affect the extent, timing, and
   duration of seasonal sea ice decrease the amount of preferred foraging
   habitat for minke whales while concurrently increasing it for humpback
   whales. Our results provide the first quantitative assessment of
   behaviorally based habitat use and sympatry between these 2 krill
   consumers and offers insight into the potential effects of a rapidly
   changing environment on the structure and function of a polar ecosystem.},

Title = {Environmental drivers of the physiological condition of mature female
   Antarctic krill during the spawning season: implications for krill
   recruitment},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {669},
Pages = {65-82},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Southern Ocean pelagic productivity relies on the abundance of Antarctic
   krill Euphausia superba, which fluctuates on a 5-7 yr cycle and is
   driven by interannual variability in recruitment. The western Antarctic
   Peninsula (wAP) is home to a significant proportion of the
   circum-Antarctic krill biomass and is the focus of the krill fishery.
   The wAP is warming at a rate quicker than most other places on Earth,
   with notable regional changes in the pelagic ecosystem. There is a major
   gap in our understanding of how environmental variability affects the
   reproductive success of krill. We used historical krill population data
   collected at the wAP (January 1993-2008, Palmer Antarctica Long Term
   Ecological Research) to assess the effects of environmental variability
   on the condition of mature female krill during the spawning season and
   its relationship with krill recruitment. Mature female krill condition
   during the spawning season was positively correlated with recruitment
   the subsequent year. Results of generalized additive models indicated
   that the predominant drivers of krill condition during the spawning
   season were climatological (Southern Annular Mode and Multivariate El
   Nino Southern Oscillation Index), though the timing of sea ice advance
   and retreat, and diatom concentrations were also important Gaining a
   better understanding of the oceanographic and climatological factors
   that affect the physiological condition of mature female krill is
   critical for predicting future demographic patterns and responses to
   change. Results from our study emphasize the importance of including the
   effects of climate change in the management models for the Antarctic
   krill fishery.},

Abstract = {In contrast to Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, Antarctic salps (Salpa
   thompsoni) respond positively to warmer water temperatures and have the
   ability to create massive blooms under favourable conditions. Therefore,
   they can compete with krill for primary production. Over the last three
   decades, significant variability in S. thompsoni occurrence has been
   observed as a response to the environmental fluctuations of the Southern
   Ocean ecosystem (e.g. changes in sea surface temperature and ice-cover
   shrinkage around the cold Antarctic waters). This study presents
   historical abundance data of salps from the south-west Atlantic Sector
   of the Southern Ocean, covering a time span of 26 years. These data
   allow tracking of fluctuations in Antarctic salp abundance and their
   distribution with bottom depth, temperature, and ice conditions, aiming
   to reveal salp hot spots and to predict the future range of S. thompsoni
   distribution with upcoming climate warming in the next 50 years. Results
   showed the highest salp density in shallow shelf waters with ice cover
   and low temperatures between 1 and -1 degrees C. In the studied area, S.
   thompsoni hot spots were located mostly around Elephant Island, but also
   the islands around Brensfield and Gerlache Straits, as well as to the
   south near the Bellingshausen Sea. Inferences made of future salp
   distribution suggest that the range of S. thompsoni will move
   southwards, enlarging their habitat area by nearly 500,000 km(2), which
   may have significant implications on the whole Antarctic food web. The
   information presented herein may be used for Antarctic ecosystem
   management, protection, and conservation.},

Title = {Overwinter sea-ice characteristics important for Antarctic krill
   recruitment in the southwest Atlantic},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate change alters the extent and structure of sea-ice environments,
   which affects how they function as a habitat for polar species.
   Identifying sea-ice characteristics that serve as indicators of habitat
   quality will be crucial to the monitoring and management of climate
   change impacts. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill is a key prey
   species and fishery target. Krill larvae depend upon sea-ice habitats to
   survive the winter and recruit to the population in spring. Existing
   observations of sea-ice characteristics lack sufficient spatiotemporal
   coverage to quantify which ones contribute to favourable overwintering
   habitat, leading to uncertainties in how current and future changes in
   sea ice affect krill populations. Here, we derive regional-scale indices
   of annual krill recruitment spanning 35 years across the southwest
   Atlantic. To develop meaningful indicators of sea-ice habitat, we
   selected variables from a high-resolution sea-ice model that are
   hypothesized as relevant for larval habitat use. The resulting
   correlations between recruitment and sea-ice indicators vary by region
   and show remote connections to sea ice that correspond with established
   theories of larval transport. Through an improved representation of
   sea-ice habitat quality, as compared with using more traditional
   satellite-derived variables such as sea-ice extent and duration, we
   highlight plausible regions of overwintering habitat. Our findings
   improve current understanding of how krill are likely responding to
   changing sea ice and support emerging views that larval habitat use is
   complex. Furthermore, regional variation in larval dependence on sea ice
   may provide pockets of resilience to change for the broader krill
   population.},

Title = {Modeling Antarctic Krill Circumpolar Spawning Habitat Quality to
   Identify Regions With Potential to Support High Larval Production},

Abstract = {Antarctic krill (krill) are important within Southern Ocean ecosystems
   and support an expanding fishery. Toward understanding krill's response
   to environmental change, it is necessary to identify regions that
   support high krill larval production (spawning habitat). We develop a
   mechanistic model combining thermal and food requirements for krill egg
   production, with predation pressure post-spawning, to predict regions of
   high-quality spawning habitat. We optimize our model regionally and
   generate circumpolar predictions of spawning habitat quality. Our
   results indicate the southwest Atlantic accounts for almost half of all
   predicted high-quality spawning habitat. Small-scale management units
   (SSMUs) around the Antarctic Peninsula had high coverage of high-quality
   spawning habitat. In contrast, the remaining SSMUs (except around South
   Georgia) were poorly covered, suggestive of population sinks reliant on
   input from external sources upstream. This implies strong potential for
   downstream impacts of fishing in key spawning areas, with implications
   for management of SSMUs and the krill fishery.},

Title = {Detecting Climate Signals in Southern Ocean Krill Growth Habitat},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Climate change is rapidly altering the habitat of Antarctic krill
   (Euphausia superba), a key species of the Southern Ocean food web. Krill
   are a critical element of Southern Ocean ecosystems as well as
   biogeochemical cycles, while also supporting an international commercial
   fishery. In addition to trends forced by global-scale, human-driven
   warming, the Southern Ocean is highly dynamic, displaying large
   fluctuations in surface climate on interannual to decadal timescales.
   The dual roles of forced climate change and natural variability
   affecting Antarctic krill habitat, and therefore productivity,
   complicate interplay of observed trends and contribute to uncertainty in
   future projections. We use the Community Earth System Model Large
   Ensemble (CESM-LE) coupled with an empirically derived model of krill
   growth to detect and attribute trends associated with ``forced,{''}
   human-driven climate change, distinguishing these from variability
   arising naturally. The forced trend in krill growth is characterized by
   a poleward contraction of optimal conditions and an overall reduction in
   Southern Ocean krill habitat. However, the amplitude of natural climate
   variability is relatively large, such that the forced trend cannot be
   formally distinguished from natural variability at local scales over
   much of the Southern Ocean by 2100. Our results illustrate how natural
   variability is an important driver of regional krill growth trends and
   can mask the forced trend until late in the 21st century. Given the
   ecological and commercial global importance of krill, this research
   helps inform current and future Southern Ocean krill management in the
   context of climate variability and change.},

Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {258},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Drastic sea ice retreats in the Antarctic Peninsula, and the consequent
   environmental changes have brought about the consequences of biological
   adaptation and food competition. The isotopic niche is reflected by the
   ecological position and functional role of a species, which can be
   altered depending on these environmental changes. We assessed the
   isotopic niche and trophic positions (TP) of 3 seabirds on the Barton
   Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica, to understand ecological
   interaction among the species. The average TP of Antarctic krill
   (Euphausia superba) (hereafter ``krill{''}) (2.6 +/- 0.1) was estimated
   by using the compiled published data of the compound-specific nitrogen
   isotope ratio of glutamic acid and phenylalanine in the Southern Ocean,
   and TP values of the seabirds based on that of krill to be reliable
   according to ecological knowledge. Our results on the overlap of the
   isotopic niches of seabirds suggests potential diet competition among
   the consumers, such as the brown skua (Stercorarius antarcticus) and
   south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), whereas the distinct and
   broad isotopic niche width of kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) suggesting
   that their adaptation through generalization was related to their
   extended habitat and various food sources. Our research indicates that
   isotopic niche of seabirds reflects their survival strategy for food
   competition. Consequently, these seabirds can be easily influenced by
   alternative food sources, including terrestrial and human-derived
   sources, by rapid environmental changes, indicating that they are
   valuable as key environmental species and require long-term monitoring
   in the Antarctic Peninsula.},

Title = {Utilising IPCC assessments to support the ecosystem approach to
   fisheries management within a warming Southern Ocean},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {131},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Southern Ocean marine ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate-driven
   change, the impacts of which must be factored into conservation and
   management. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
   Living Resources (CCAMLR) is aware of the urgent need to develop
   climate-responsive options within its ecosystem approach to management.
   However, limited capacity as well as political differences have meant
   that little progress has been made. Strengthening scientific information
   flow to inform CCAMLR's decision-making on climate change may help to
   remove some of these barriers. On this basis, this study encourages the
   utilisation of outputs from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC's 2019 Special Report on the Ocean
   and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) constitutes the most
   rigorous and up-todate assessment of how oceans and the cryosphere are
   changing, how they are projected to change, and the consequences of
   those changes, together with a range of response options. To assist
   CCAMLR to focus on what is most useful from this extensive global
   report, SROCC findings that have specific relevance to the management of
   Southern Ocean ecosystems are extracted and summarised here. These
   findings are translated into recommendations to CCAMLR, emphasising the
   need to reduce and manage the risks that climate change presents to
   harvested species and the wider ecosystem of which they are part.
   Improved linkages between IPCC, CCAMLR and other relevant bodies may
   help overcome existing impediments to progress, enabling climate change
   to become fully integrated into CCAMLR's policy and decision-making.},

Title = {Evidence for the Impact of Climate Change on Primary Producers in the
   Southern Ocean},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Within the framework of the Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern
   Ocean (MEASO), this paper brings together analyses of recent trends in
   phytoplankton biomass, primary production and irradiance at the base of
   the mixed layer in the Southern Ocean and summarises future projections.
   Satellite observations suggest that phytoplankton biomass in the
   mixed-layer has increased over the last 20 years in most (but not all)
   parts of the Southern Ocean, whereas primary production at the base of
   the mixed-layer has likely decreased over the same period. Different
   satellite models of primary production (Vertically Generalised versus
   Carbon Based Production Models) give different patterns and directions
   of recent change in net primary production (NPP). At present, the
   satellite record is not long enough to distinguish between trends and
   climate-related cycles in primary production. Over the next 100 years,
   Earth system models project increasing NPP in the water column in the
   MEASO northern and Antarctic zones but decreases in the Subantarctic
   zone. Low confidence in these projections arises from: (1) the
   difficulty in mapping supply mechanisms for key nutrients (silicate,
   iron); and (2) understanding the effects of multiple stressors
   (including irradiance, nutrients, temperature, pCO(2), pH, grazing) on
   different species of Antarctic phytoplankton. Notwithstanding these
   uncertainties, there are likely to be changes to the seasonal patterns
   of production and the microbial community present over the next 50-100
   years and these changes will have ecological consequences across
   Southern Ocean food-webs, especially on key species such as Antarctic
   krill and silverfish.},

Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Survival of larval Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) during winter is
   largely dependent upon the presence of sea ice as it provides an
   important source of food and shelter. We hypothesized that sea ice
   provides additional benefits because it hosts fewer competitors and
   provides reduced predation risk for krill larvae than the water column.
   To test our hypothesis, zooplankton were sampled in the Weddell-Scotia
   Confluence Zone at the ice-water interface (0-2 m) and in the water
   column (0-500 m) during August-October 2013. Grazing by mesozooplankton,
   expressed as a percentage of the phytoplankton standing stock, was
   higher in the water column (1.97 +/- 1.84\%) than at the ice-water
   interface (0.08 +/- 0.09\%), due to a high abundance of pelagic
   copepods. Predation risk by carnivorous macrozooplankton, expressed as a
   percentage of the mesozooplankton standing stock, was significantly
   lower at the ice-water interface (0.83 +/- 0.57\%; main predators
   amphipods, siphonophores and ctenophores) than in the water column (4.72
   +/- 5.85\%; main predators chaetognaths and medusae). These results
   emphasize the important role of sea ice as a suitable winter habitat for
   larval krill with fewer competitors and lower predation risk. These
   benefits should be taken into account when considering the response of
   Antarctic krill to projected declines in sea ice. Whether reduced
   sea-ice algal production may be compensated for by increased water
   column production remains unclear, but the shelter provided by sea ice
   would be significantly reduced or disappear, thus increasing the

Abstract = {Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a key species in the Southern
   Ocean, where its habitat is projected to undergo continued warming and
   increases in pCO(2). Experiments during 2 summer field seasons at Palmer
   Station, Antarctica, investigated the independent and interactive
   effects of elevated temperature and pCO(2) (decreased pH) on feeding,
   growth, acid-base physiology, metabolic rate, and survival of adult
   Antarctic krill. Ingestion and clearance rates of chlorophyll were
   depressed under low pH (7.7) compared to ambient pH (8.1) after a 48 h
   acclimation period, but this difference disappeared after a 21 d
   acclimation. Growth rates were negligible and frequently negative, but
   were significantly more negative at high (3 degrees C, -0.03 mm d(-1))
   compared to ambient temperature (0 degrees C, -0.01 mm d(-1)) with no
   effect of pH. Modest elevations in tissue total CO2 and tissue pH were
   apparent at low pH but were short-lived. Metabolic rate increased with
   temperature but was suppressed at low pH in smaller but not larger
   krill. Although effects of elevated temperature and/or decreased pH were
   mostly sublethal, mortality was higher at high temperature/low pH (58\%)
   compared to ambient temperature/pH or ambient temperature/low pH (>
   90\%). This study identified 3 dominant patterns: (1) shorter-term
   effects were primarily pH-dependent; (2) krill compensated for lower pH
   relatively quickly; and (3) longer-term effects on krill growth and
   survival were strongly driven by temperature with little to no pH
   effect.},

Title = {Facing Southern Ocean warming: Temperature effects on whole animal
   performance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)},
Journal = {ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {146},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The ongoing environmental changes in the Southern Ocean may cause a
   dramatic decrease in habitat quality. Due to its central position in the
   food web, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species of the
   marine Antarctic ecosystem. It is therefore crucial to understand how
   increasing water temperatures affect important krill life-cycle
   processes. Here, a long-term (August - March) laboratory acclimation
   experiment at different temperature scenarios (0.5 degrees C, 1.5
   degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, 3.5 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 7 degrees C) was
   performed and the effects of elevated temperatures on whole animal
   parameters (O2 consumption, body length, length of the digestive gland)
   were analyzed. The response of krill oxygen consumption to different
   experimental temperatures differed between acute/short-term and
   long-term acclimation. After 8 months, krill oxygen consumption remained
   unchanged up to temperatures of 3.5 degrees C and was significantly
   higher at temperatures > 3.5 degrees C. Krill acclimated to temperatures
   > 3.5 degrees C were significantly smaller at the end of the experiment.
   Limited food intake and/or conversion may have contributed to this
   effect, especially pronounced after the onset of the reproductive
   period. In addition, the seasonal growth pattern in males differed from
   that of females. Together, our findings indicate that warming Southern
   Ocean waters are likely to increase metabolic rate in krill, possibly
   altering the amount of energy available for other important life-cycle
   processes, a finding directly related to future population dynamics and
   fisheries management.},

Title = {An integrated field-laboratory investigation of the effects of low
   oxygen and pH on North Pacific krill (Euphausia pacifica)},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Number = {4},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Krill are abundant and ecologically important zooplankton that inhabit
   dynamic environments characterized by strong natural variability, but
   global ocean change is shifting the range of conditions that they
   experience. Laboratory tests reveal that krill are sensitive to ocean
   acidification despite residing in naturally low pH areas, showing the
   importance of modulating factors for determining their responses. This
   study combines laboratory manipulations with field observations across a
   strong natural water chemistry gradient in Puget Sound, Washington, USA
   to investigate the effects of pH and oxygen on adult female North
   Pacific krill, Euphausia pacifica. Enzyme activities of the Electron
   Transport System (ETS) and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS) were used
   as indices of zooplankton metabolism and growth, respectively, and were
   paired with traditional incubation methods. Acclimation to pH and oxygen
   conditions in the laboratory did not reveal effects on respiration rate,
   ETS, or AARS activity of krill. However, field observations showed that
   respiratory potential, as estimated by ETS activity, decreased with
   decreasing oxygen, declining 9\% (95\% confidence interval 2.5-15\%)
   over the range of conditions we observed (3.9-8.1 mg O-2 L-1). This
   reduction would depress the metabolic potential of krill in areas of
   stressful conditions (concurrent low pH), though krill also displayed a
   high degree of inter-individual variability. Although differences in age
   structure suggest different patterns of recruitment between E. pacifica
   populations in areas with stressful conditions and those without,
   populations persist at stressful sites. Lower temperature of waters with
   low oxygen and pH, as well as high food concentrations, may contribute
   to these populations' success.},

Abstract = {The diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at South Georgia
   is dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). During the breeding
   season, foraging trips by lactating female fur seals are constrained by
   their need to return to land to provision their pups. Post-breeding,
   seals disperse in order to feed and recover condition; estimates
   indicate c.70\% of females remain near to South Georgia, whilst others
   head west towards the Patagonian Shelf or south to the ice-edge. The
   krill fishery at South Georgia operates only during the winter,
   providing the potential for fur seal: fishery interaction during these
   months. Here we use available winter (May to September) tracking data
   from Platform Terminal Transmitter (PTT) tags deployed on female fur
   seals at Bird Island, South Georgia. We develop habitat models
   describing their distribution during the winters of 1999 and 2003 with
   the aim of visualising and quantifying the degree of spatial overlap
   between female fur seals and krill harvesting in South Georgia waters.
   We show that spatial distribution of fur seals around South Georgia is
   extensive, and that the krill fishery overlaps with small, highly
   localised areas of available fur seal habitat. From these findings we
   discuss the implications for management, and future work.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {After declining in abundance due to commercial whaling during the 20th
   century, populations of the Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus
   intermedia) have failed to recover to pre-exploitation levels. Using
   historical whaling data from 1926-1954, in combination with temperature
   data for the Southern Ocean, a gamma GLM with temporal dependency was
   fitted to 20,144 records of B. m. intermedia foetus size using Bayesian
   inference. There was a negative relationship between antecedent winter
   sea surface temperature (SST) in the Southern Ocean on foetus size. This
   relationship is proposed as being mediated by a positive effect of the
   extent of winter sea ice on Antarctic krill (Euphasia superba) abundance
   on which B. m. intermedia feed. There was also a positive
   density-dependent effect of a ``krill surplus{''} at low B. m.
   intermedia population sizes. However, the positive effect of a ``krill
   surplus{''} at low B. m. intermedia population size on foetus growth was
   reversed at elevated winter SST due to a proposed negative impact on E.
   superba recruitment. Projected increases in temperature in the Southern
   Ocean are predicted to compromise the growth rates of B. m. intermedia
   foetuses, with implications for the capacity of the subspecies to
   recover from overexploitation.},

Title = {Future Risk for Southern Ocean Ecosystem Services Under Climate Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {The Southern Ocean supports ecosystem services that are important on a
   global scale. Climate change and human activities (tourism, fishing, and
   research) will affect both the demand for, and the provision of, these
   services into the future. Here we synthesize recent assessments of the
   current status and expected future climate-driven changes in Southern
   Ocean ecosystems and evaluate the potential consequences of these
   changes for the provision of ecosystem services. We explore in detail
   three key services (the `blue carbon' pathway, the Antarctic krill
   fishery, and Antarctic tourism), tracing the consequences of climate
   change from physical drivers through biological impacts to the benefits
   to humans. We consider potential non-climatic drivers of change, current
   and future demands for the services, and the main global and regional
   policy frameworks that could be used to manage risks to the provision of
   these services in a changing climate. We also develop a formal
   representation of the network of interactions between the suite of
   potential drivers and the suite of services, providing a framework to
   capture the complexity of this network and its embedded feedback loops.
   Increased consideration of the linkages and feedbacks between drivers
   and ecosystem services will be required to underpin robust management
   responses into the future.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},

Volume = {96},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Important findings from the second decade of the 21st century on the
   impact of environmental change on biological processes in the Antarctic
   were synthesised by 26 international experts. Ten key messages emerged
   that have stakeholder-relevance and/or a high impact for the scientific
   community. They address (i) altered biogeochemical cycles, (ii) ocean
   acidification, (iii) climate change hotspots, (iv) unexpected dynamism
   in seabed-dwelling populations, (v) spatial range shifts, (vi)
   adaptation and thermal resilience, (vii) sea ice related biological
   fluctuations, (viii) pollution, (ix) endangered terrestrial endemism and
   (x) the discovery of unknown habitats. Most Antarctic biotas are exposed
   to multiple stresses and considered vulnerable to environmental change
   due to narrow tolerance ranges, rapid change, projected circumpolar
   impacts, low potential for timely genetic adaptation, and migration
   barriers. Important ecosystem functions, such as primary production and
   energy transfer between trophic levels, have already changed, and
   biodiversity patterns have shifted. A confidence assessment of the
   degree of `scientific understanding' revealed an intermediate level for
   most of the more detailed sub-messages, indicating that process-oriented
   research has been successful in the past decade. Additional efforts are
   necessary, however, to achieve the level of robustness in scientific
   knowledge that is required to inform protection measures of the unique
   Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and their contributions to
   global biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Title = {Evaluating Antarctic marine protected area scenarios using a dynamic
   food web model},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {251},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas, especially when they are or include no-take
   zones, can support conservation objectives by creating an area where
   marine organisms are protected from human disturbances, particularly
   fishing. The coast of the Antarctic continent is the only habitat of the
   iconic Adelie penguin, whose main diet is Antarctic krill. Current
   threats to Adelie Penguins, other Antarctic krill predators and
   Antarctic krill itself include sea-ice loss as a result of climate
   change and krill fishing. We use a spatially and temporally dynamic food
   web model of the region surrounding the Western Antarctic Peninsula to
   evaluate the potential impacts of various marine protected area
   scenarios in the context of climate change. We examine the effects of
   sustained sea-ice loss on krill and seven monitored krill predators. We
   evaluate four marine protected area scenarios given two scenarios that
   describe future changes in sea ice and three scenarios that describe
   future changes in krill fishing effort. Our results indicate that
   establishing no-take zones where krill might aggregate in the future and
   where some krill predators forage could positively affect biomass
   accumulation of krill and the predators. No-take zones may be
   particularly important for enhancing the resilience of species that have
   recently experienced population decline and ensuring positive outcomes
   from establishing a marine protected area in the region. Our simulations
   suggest that establishing protected areas in the right locations can
   play an important role in mitigating the negative effects of climate
   change on iconic species that many people want to conserve.},

Title = {Climate-driven variability in Euphausia pacifica size distributions off
   northern California},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {188},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We analyzed an 11-year data set of length measurements for Euphausia
   pacifica, resolved by developmental stages ranging from early furcilia
   through adults, to characterize temporal variability in size
   distributions in relation to environmental and climate forcing in
   coastal waters of the northern California Current. Our analysis reveals
   that coastal size distributions of this linchpin species are related to
   temperature and chlorophyll a concentration, and indicate that warm
   climate events disrupt and suppress typical seasonal dynamics, resulting
   in persistent shifts towards populations dominated by smaller juveniles
   and adults. The 2014-16 marine heatwave (MHW) resulted in sharp and
   sustained transition in the size structure of E. pacifica off northern
   California; we captured numerous mature individuals smaller than any
   previously reported in the literature and larger size classes were
   conspicuously absent or rare when the MHW most strongly impacted coastal
   waters. Early life history stages exhibited a contrasting response,
   shifting instead towards larger size distributions during warm years.
   Advection appears to be the dominant mechanism driving rapid shifts in
   E. pacifica size structure off northern California, which implies
   alongshore and cross-shelf gradients in life history expression (e.g.,
   changes in size-at-maturation) related primarily to temperature.
   Variability in food availability (chlorophyll concentration) and
   physiological responses (e.g., changes in growth rates) likely
   contribute to seasonal variability, but appear insufficient to account
   for sharp, climate-driven transitions. Climate-driven shifts in
   individual and total biomass of this critical and dominant forage
   species have important ecological implications, particularly for growth
   and survival of species at higher trophic levels. Given that warm water
   events are likely to increase with climate change, the effects of the
   2014-16 MHW on E. pacifica in coastal waters may serve as a harbinger
   for future change. Detailed information on size structure of euphausiid
   populations is fundamental to understanding population responses to and
   ecosystem consequences of climatic and environmental forcing, and has
   been incorporated in assessments that support ecosystem-based approaches
   to fisheries management.},

   on the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery and krill-dependent
   predators in the Scotia Sea, explicitly addressing the displacement of
   fishing from closed areas. For both scenarios, we employed a minimally
   realistic, spatially explicit ecosystem model and considered three
   alternative redistributions of displaced fishing. We projected both MPAs
   to provide positive outcomes for many krill-dependent predators,
   especially when closed areas included at least 50-75\% of their foraging
   distributions. Further, differences between the scenarios suggest ways
   to improve seal and penguin protection in the Scotia Sea. MPA scenarios
   also projected increases in total fishery yields, but alongside risks of
   fishing in areas where relatively low krill densities could cause the
   fishery to suspend operations. The three alternatives for redistributing
   displaced fishing had little effect on benefits to predators, but did
   matter for the fishery, with greater differences in overall catch and
   risk of fishing in areas of low krill density when displaced fishing was
   redistributed evenly among the open areas. Collectively, results suggest
   a well-designed MPA in the Scotia Sea may protect krill-dependent
   predators, even with displaced fishing, and preclude further spatial
   management of the krill fishery outside the MPA. More broadly, outcomes
   denote the importance of delineating fishing and predator habitat,
   spatial scales, and the critical trade-offs inherent in MPA development.},

Title = {Demographic and maturity patterns of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)

Abstract = {Overwinter environmental conditions are a major driver of larval
   survival, recruitment, and reproductive pre-conditioning in Antarctic
   krill (Euphausia superba). Few winter studies exist from which to infer
   impacts of changing environmental conditions on the biology of krill.
   Here demographic and maturity patterns of krill during five winters are
   examined at an overwintering hotspot in the northern Antarctic
   Peninsula. Two different recruitment pulses were present over the 5
   years of the study. A large recruitment event was evident in winter
   2012, followed by cohort growth tracked through winter 2014. A
   recruitment event also occurred in 2015, despite lower abundance of
   larvae in 2013 and 2014. The recruitment pulse in 2015 was correlated
   with the intrusion of high salinity water, characteristic of the Weddell
   Sea, during a positive El Nino-Southern Oscillation phase, suggesting
   recruitment was driven by advection of recruits into the northern
   Antarctic Peninsula. Despite the inter-annual environmental variability,
   most female krill were in resting reproductive stages in all years. The
   lack of variability in female reproductive status during winter may
   impose a developmental constraint to earlier spawning than previously
   considered; the time necessary to advance from resting stages to
   reproductive maturity may limit the ability of krill to adapt to trends
   in the timing and magnitude of the spring bloom. The observed patterns
   of recruitment and variation in maturity stages highlight the complexity
   of krill population dynamics and should be considered when projecting
   population responses of Antarctic krill to climate-driven changes in the
   Southern Ocean.},

Title = {Modeling predator and prey hotspots: Management implications of baleen
   whale co-occurrence with krill in Central California},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {As global ocean-bound commerce increases, managing human activities has
   become important in reducing conflict with threatened wildlife. This
   study investigates environmental factors determining abundance and
   distribution of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), humpback whales
   (Megaptera novaeangliae) and their prey (Euphausia
   pacificaandThysanoessa spinifera) in central California. We provide
   insights into environmental drivers of the ecology and distribution of
   these species, model whale distributions and determine coincident
   hotspots of whales and their prey that will help decrease human threats
   to whales and protect critical feeding habitat. We developed separate
   predictive models of whale abundances (using negative binomial
   regression on count data) and krill abundance (using a two-part
   hurdlemodel combining logistic and negative binomial regressions) over a
   14 year period (2004-2017). Variables includedin situsurface and
   midwater oceanographic measures (temperature, salinity, and
   fluorescence), basin-scale climate indices, and bathymetric- and
   distance-related data. Predictions were applied to 1 km(2)cells spanning
   the study area for May, June, July, and September during each of the 14
   years of surveys to identify persistent distribution patterns. Both
   whales and krill were found to consistently use the northeast region of
   Cordell Bank, the Farallon Escarpment, and the shelf-break waters. The
   main identified blue whale hotspots were also krill hotspots, while
   co-occurrence was more limited and varied seasonally for humpback whales
   and krill. These results are valuable in identifying patterns in
   important areas of ecological interaction to assist management of
   whales. Areas north of Cordell Bank are of particular management concern
   since they overlap with the end of the San Francisco Bay northern
   shipping lane. Our findings can help decrease threats to whales,
   particularly in important foraging areas, by supporting implementation
   of vessel management and informing potential conflicts with other human
   uses.},

Title = {Blooms of a key grazer in the Southern Ocean - An individual-based model
   of Salpa thompsoni},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {185},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Southern Ocean near the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is
   strongly affected by climate change resulting in warmer air temperature,
   accompanied with reduced sea ice coverage, increased sea water
   temperature and potential changes in the abundances of two key grazer
   species Salpa thompsoni (salp) and Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill).
   While salp abundance is hypothesized to increase, krill abundance is
   hypothesized to decline with dramatic consequences for the entire food
   web of the Southern Ocean. A better understanding of the biotic
   interaction between krill and salps and their population dynamics is
   thus crucial. However, the life cycle of salps is complicated and barely
   understood. Therefore, we have developed an individual-based model
   describing the whole life cycle to better understand the population
   dynamics of salps and the conditions for blooms. The model has been used
   to explore if and under what conditions the empirical pattern of large
   variability in observed salp abundances at the WAP, generated by the
   long-term data of the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources Program
   (AMLR) can emerge from a small seeding population. The model reproduced
   this empirical pattern if daily growth rates of oozoids were higher than
   previously reported for the WAP (mean growth rate for oozoids similar to
   1 mm d(-1)) and if growth rates of blastozooids were lower (mean growth
   rate similar to 0.2 mm d(-1)). The model suggests that a prerequisite
   for local salp blooms requires a small founding population in early
   spring. With climate change it has been suggested that more frequent and
   earlier transport of salps into the WAP or winter survival will occur.
   Hence, the risk of salp blooms in the WAP is likely to substantially
   increase. These findings highlight the importance for an improved
   quantitative understanding of how primary production and the southward
   advection of salps will be impacted by climate change.},

Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Pages = {568+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The impact of climate change on the circumpolar distribution of the key
   Antarctic food-web species, krill, is unknown. Combining a krill growth
   model with projected climate scenarios shows the growth habitat is
   likely to experience only moderate change, with the northern edges most
   at risk.
   Antarctic krill is a key species of important Southern Ocean food webs,
   yet how changes in ocean temperature and primary production may impact
   their habitat quality remains poorly understood. We provide a
   circumpolar assessment of the robustness of krill growth habitat to
   climate change by coupling an empirical krill growth model with
   projections from a weighted subset of IPCC Earth system models. We find
   that 85\% of the study area experienced only a moderate change in
   relative gross growth potential (+/- 20\%) by 2100. However, a temporal
   shift in seasonal timings of habitat quality may cause disjunctions
   between krill's biological timings and the future environment. Regions
   likely to experience habitat quality decline or retreat are concentrated
   near the northern limits of krill distribution and in the
   Amundsen-Bellingshausen seas region during autumn, meaning habitat will
   likely shift to higher latitudes in these areas.},

Title = {The policy relevance of Southern Ocean food web structure: Implications
   of food web change for fisheries, conservation and carbon sequestration},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {115},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Southern Ocean food webs provide ecosystem services with significant
   global value including carbon sequestration, fisheries and the existence
   of iconic wildlife. These services are underpinned by different
   energetic pathways including those dominated by Antarctic krill, fishes
   and squids, or gelatinous zooplankton (salps). Climate change is likely
   to impact Southern Ocean food webs by affecting their foundations - both
   primary producer communities and ice habitats. However, the implications
   of these changes for ecosystem services - including wildlife
   populations, fisheries and carbon sequestration - are unclear, as are
   the implications for policy and management. Here, we use a generalised
   representation of Southern Ocean food webs and qualitative network
   modelling to investigate the consequences of five simple but plausible
   scenarios of future change for ecosystem services and the conservation
   of important taxa: (i) a shift in primary producer communities with
   decreasing large diatoms and increasing small flagellates; (ii)
   increasing salps; (iii) increase (recovery) of the Great whales; and
   unregulated and unsustainable fisheries for (iv) krill or (v) toothfish.
   Strikingly, our results suggest that increases in salps might not have
   negative consequences for ecosystem services and could enhance carbon
   export potential. Simulated increases in unregulated krill and toothfish
   fisheries affect predatory wildlife and could also reduce carbon export
   potential. Our results emphasise the important policy implications of
   understanding the structure and change of whole food webs, and highlight
   that improved quantitative understanding and modelling of the relative
   importance of different energy pathways will be important for developing
   robust management responses to climate change impacts.},

Title = {Projected shifts in the foraging habitat of crabeater seals along the
   Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Pages = {472+},

Abstract = {Crabeater seals exhibit extreme dietary specialization, feeding almost
   exclusively on Antarctic krill. This specialization has inextricably
   linked habitat use, life history and evolution of this pinniped species
   to the distribution of its prey. Therefore, the foraging habitat of
   crabeater seals can be used to infer the distribution of Antarctic
   krill. Here, we combined seal movements and diving behaviour with
   environmental variables to build a foraging habitat model for crabeater
   seals for the rapidly changing western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Our
   projections show that future crabeater seal foraging habitat and, by
   inference, krill distribution will expand towards offshore waters and
   the southern WAP in response to changes in circulation, water
   temperature and sea ice distribution. Antarctic krill biomass is
   projected to be negatively affected by the environmental changes, which
   are anticipated to manifest as a decrease in krill densities in coastal
   waters, with impacts on the land-/ice-based krill predator community,
   particularly in the northern WAP.
   Crabeater seals feed predominantly on Antarctic krill. Combining seal
   tracks and diving behaviour with environmental variables allows the
   future foraging habitat, and therefore krill distribution, to be
   predicted, suggesting a shift offshore and south along the western
   Antarctic Peninsula.},

Title = {Antarctic Krill Lipid and Fatty acid Content Variability is Associated
   to Satellite Derived Chlorophyll a and Sea Surface Temperatures},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 8},
Abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a key component of the Antarctic
   food web with considerable lipid reserves that are vital for their
   health and higher predator survival. Krill lipids are primarily derived
   from their diet of plankton, in particular diatoms and flagellates. Few
   attempts have been made to link the spatial and temporal variations in
   krill lipids to those in their food supply. Remotely-sensed
   environmental parameters provide large-scale information on the
   potential availability of krill food, although relating this to
   physiological and biochemical differences has only been performed on
   small scales and with limited samples. Our study utilised
   remotely-sensed data (chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature) coupled
   with krill lipid data obtained from 3 years of fishery-derived samples.
   We examined within and between year variation of trends in both the
   environment and krill biochemistry data. Chlorophyll a levels were
   positively related to krill lipid levels, particularly triacylglycerol.
   Plankton fatty acid biomarkers analysed in krill (such as n-3
   polyunsaturated fatty acids) increased with decreasing sea surface
   temperature and increasing chlorophyll a levels. Our study demonstrates
   the utility of combining remote-sensing and biochemical data in
   examining biological and physiological relationships between Antarctic
   krill and the Southern Ocean environment.},

Title = {SealNet: A fully-automated pack-ice seal detection pipeline for
   sub-meter satellite imagery},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {239},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Antarctic pack-ice seals, a group of four species of true seals
   (Phocidae), play a pivotal role in the Southern Ocean foodweb as
   wide-ranging predators of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Due to
   their circumpolar distribution and the remoteness and vastness of their
   habitat, little is known about their population sizes. Estimating
   pack-ice seal population sizes and trends is key to understanding how
   the Southern Ocean ecosystem will react to threats such as climate
   change driven sea ice loss and krill fishing. We present a functional
   pack-ice seal detection pipeline using Worldview-3 imagery and a
   Convolutional Neural Network that counts and locates seal centroids. We
   propose a new CNN architecture that detects objects by combining
   semantic segmentation heatmaps with binary classification and counting
   by regression. Our pipeline locates over 30\% of seals, when compared to
   consensus counts from human experts, and reduces the time required for
   seal detection by 95\% (assuming just a single GPU). While larger
   training sets and continued algorithm development will no doubt improve
   classification accuracy, our pipeline, which can be easily adapted for
   other large-bodied animals visible in sub-meter satellite imagery,
   demonstrates the potential for machine learning to vastly expand our
   capacity for regular pack-ice seal surveys and, in doing so, will
   contribute to ongoing international efforts to monitor pack-ice seals.},

Title = {Long-term observations from Antarctica demonstrate that mismatched
   scales of fisheries management and predator-prey interaction lead to
   erroneous conclusions about precaution},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {Low catch limits for forage species are often considered to be
   precautionary measures that can help conserve marine predators.
   Difficulties measuring the impacts of fisheries removals on dependent
   predators maintain this perspective, but consideration of the
   spatio-temporal scales over which forage species, their predators, and
   fisheries interact can aid assessment of whether low catch limits are as
   precautionary as presumed. Antarctic krill are targeted by the largest
   fishery in the Southern Ocean and are key forage for numerous predators.
   Current krill removals are considered precautionary and have not been
   previously observed to affect krill-dependent predators, like penguins.
   Using a hierarchical model and 30+ years of monitoring data, we show
   that expected penguin performance was reduced when local harvest rates
   of krill were >= 0.1, and this effect was similar in magnitude to that
   of poor environmental conditions. With continued climate warming and
   high local harvest rates, future observations of penguin performance are
   predicted to be below the long-term mean with a probability of 0.77.
   Catch limits that are considered precautionary for forage species simply
   because the limit is a small proportion of the species' standing biomass
   may not be precautionary for their predators.},

Journal = {TROPICAL LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-209},
Abstract = {Digestive proteases from marine organisms have been poorly applied to
   biomedicine. Exceptions are trypsin and other digestive proteases from a
   few cold-adapted or temperate fish and crustacean species. These enzymes
   are more efficient than enzymes from microorganism and higher
   vertebrates that have been used traditionally. However, the biomedical
   potential of digestive proteases from warm environment species has
   received less research attention. This review aims to provide an
   overview of this unrealised biomedical potential, using the debridement
   application as a paradigm. Debridement is intended to remove nonviable,
   necrotic and contaminated tissue, as well as fibrin clots, and is a key
   step in wound treatment. We discuss the physiological role of enzymes in
   wound healing, the use of exogenous enzymes in debridement, and the
   limitations of cold-adapted enzymes such as their poor thermal
   stability. We show that digestive proteases from tropical crustaceans
   may have advantages over their cold-adapted counterparts for this and
   similar uses. Differences in thermal stability, auto-proteolytic
   stability, and susceptibility to proteinase inhibitors are discussed.
   Furthermore, it is proposed that the feeding behaviour of the source
   organism may direct the evaluation of enzymes for particular
   applications, as digestive proteases have evolved to fill a wide variety
   of feeding habitats, natural substrates, and environmental conditions.
   We encourage more research on the biomedical application of digestive
   enzymes from tropical marine crustaceans.},

Abstract = {Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) colonies are found on
   sub-Antarctic islands around the continent. These islands experience a
   range of conditions in terms of physical and biological habitat,
   creating a natural laboratory to investigate local genetic adaptation.
   One striking habitat difference is in the availability of Euphausia
   superba krill as prey, which has led to A. gazella exhibiting a range of
   diets. A. gazella in some colonies consume exclusively krill, while
   their conspecifics in other colonies feed mainly on fish and consume few
   to no krill. To investigate potential adaptations to these different
   prey fields, reduced representation genome sequencing was conducted on
   A. gazella from the 8 major colonies. Twenty-seven genomic regions
   exhibiting signatures of natural selection were identified. Two of these
   genomic regions were clearly associated with seals living in
   krill-dominated areas or those in fish-dominated areas. Twenty-two
   additional genomic regions under selection showed a pattern consistent
   with prey differences as the driver of selection after historical
   migrations from krill-dominated habitats where lineages evolved to
   present krill-poor habitat areas were taken into account. Only 1 of the
   genomic regions identified appeared to be explained by any other
   environmental variable analysed (depth). Genomic regions under
   prey-driven selection included genes associated with regulation of gene
   expression, skeletal development, and lipid metabolism. Adaptation to
   local prey has implications for spatial management of this species and
   for the potential impacts of climate- or harvest-driven reductions in
   krill abundance on these seals.},

Abstract = {Understanding how changes in oceanographic conditions affect predators
   and their prey is fundamental for interpreting variability in natural
   marine ecosystems. At South Georgia, Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus
   gazella are known cephalopod predators and potential indicators of
   changes in regional environment conditions and prey availability. The
   cephalopod component of the diet of Antarctic fur seals at South Georgia
   was assessed using lower beaks found in scats collected over 5
   consecutive years (2009-2013) under known variable oceanographic
   conditions. In years of unusually warm oceanographic conditions around
   South Georgia and low Antarctic krill Euphausia superba density, the
   number of squids Slosarczykovia circumantarctica increased in the seals'
   diet. Moreover, stable isotope analysis of beaks showed that S.
   circumantarctica exhibited higher delta N-15 values in years that were
   associated with an offshore habitat (lower delta C-13 values) where
   Antarctic fur seals had been foraging. This study provides evidence of
   the ecological links between the feeding behaviour of Antarctic fur
   seals, their main cephalopod prey, Antarctic krill densities and
   oceanographic conditions.},

Title = {Assessing the recovery of an Antarctic predator from historical
   exploitation},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The recovery of whale populations from centuries of exploitation will
   have important management and ecological implications due to greater
   exposure to anthropogenic activities and increasing prey consumption.
   Here, a Bayesian population model integrates catch data, estimates of
   abundance, and information on genetics and biology to assess the
   recovery of western South Atlantic (WSA) humpback whales (Megaptera
   novaeangliae). Modelling scenarios evaluated the sensitivity of model
   outputs resulting from the use of different data, different model
   assumptions and uncertainty in catch allocation and in accounting for
   whales killed but not landed. A long period of exploitation drove WSA
   humpback whales to the brink of extinction. They declined from nearly 27
   000 (95\% PI = 22 800-33 000) individuals in 1830 to only 450 (95\% PI =
   200-1400) whales in the mid-1950s. Protection led to a strong recovery
   and the current population is estimated to be at 93\% (95\% PI =
   73-100\%) of its pre-exploitation size. The recovery of WSA humpback
   whales may result in large removals of their primary prey, the Antarctic
   krill (Euphausia superba), and has the potential to modify the community
   structure in their feeding grounds. Continued monitoring is needed to
   understand how these whales will respond to modern threats and to
   climate-driven changes to their habitats.},

Title = {High inter- and intraspecific niche overlap among three sympatrically
   breeding, closely related seabird species: Generalist foraging as an
   adaptation to a highly variable environment?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {89},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ecological niche theory predicts sympatric species to show segregation
   in their spatio-temporal habitat utilization or diet as a strategy to
   avoid competition. Similarly, within species individuals may specialize
   on specific dietary resources or foraging habitats. Such individual
   specialization seems to occur particularly in environments with
   predictable resource distribution and limited environmental variability.
   Still, little is known about how seasonal environmental variability
   affects segregation of resources within species and between closely
   related sympatric species. The aim of the study was to investigate the
   foraging behaviour of three closely related and sympatrically breeding
   fulmarine petrels (Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica, cape
   petrels Daption capense and southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides) in a
   seasonally highly variable environment (Prydz Bay, Antarctica) with the
   aim of assessing inter- and intraspecific overlap in utilized habitat,
   timing of foraging and diet and to identify foraging habitat
   preferences. We used GPS loggers with wet/dry sensors to assess spatial
   habitat utilization over the entire breeding season. Trophic overlap was
   investigated using stable isotope analysis based on blood, feathers and
   egg membranes. Foraging locations were identified using wet/dry data
   recorded by the GPS loggers and expectation-maximization binary
   clustering. Foraging habitat preferences were modelled using generalized
   additive models and model cross-validation. During incubation and
   chick-rearing, the utilization distribution of all three species
   overlapped significantly and species also overlapped in the timing of
   foraging during the day-partly during incubation and completely during
   chick-rearing. Isotopic centroids showed no significant segregation
   between at least two species for feathers and egg membranes, and among
   all species during incubation (reflected by blood). Within species,
   there was no individual specialization in foraging sites or
   environmental space. Furthermore, no single environmental covariate
   predicted foraging activity along trip trajectories. Instead,
   best-explanatory environmental covariates varied within and between
   individuals even across short temporal scales, reflecting a highly
   generalist behaviour of birds. Our results may be explained by optimal
   foraging theory. In the highly productive but spatio-temporally variable
   Antarctic environment, being a generalist may be key to finding mobile
   prey-even though this increases the potential for competition within and
   among sympatric species.},

Abstract = {Foraging efficiency (FE) is determined by the ratio of energy intake to
   energy expenditure and represents a metric for estimating the capacity
   to store energy. Blue whales Balaenoptera musculus rely mostly on stored
   energy reserves for reproduction. They feed almost exclusively on krill,
   which vary in density and abundance both spatially and temporally. We
   used 10 depth-velocity archival tags deployed on blue whales foraging in
   the St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada, to identify feeding events. We modeled
   krill densities required to equal or exceed energy expenditures and
   allow energy storage. During the daytime, blue whales generally dove
   deeper and performed fewer but longer feeding dives than at other times
   of the diel cycle (10 vs. 28 feeding dives h(-1)); however, they
   performed more lunges per dive during daytime (3 vs. 1 lunge dive(-1)),
   which resulted in a stable feeding rate around the clock. Only 11.7 and
   5.5 \% of the Arctic and northern krill patches measured in situ
   contained densities allowing blue whales to achieve neutral energetic
   balance (FE = 1); less than 1.5 \% of patches allowed FE of >= 3. While
   FE leading to successful reproduction and adequate fitness is unknown,
   these results underscore the necessity for blue whales to seek the
   highest densities within patches to reach neutral balance or allow
   energy storage. These findings further our understanding of blue whale
   foraging ecology and habitat suitability, and may help predict the
   effects of climate and natural variability or of potential fisheries on
   krill densities and blue whale condition.},

Title = {Environmental drivers of humpback whale foraging behavior in the remote
   Southern Ocean},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {517},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Satellite telemetry and animal movement models advance our ability to
   remotely monitor the behavior of wideranging species. Understanding how
   different behaviors (e.g. foraging) are shaped by dynamic environmental
   features is fundamental to understanding ecological interactions and the
   impact of variability. In this study we deployed satellite-linked tags
   on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and used state-space models
   to estimate locations and to infer underlying behavioral states. We then
   modelled the association between whale behavior (e.g. foraging or
   transiting) and environmental variables using linear mixed-effect
   models, We identified the importance of two recently discovered Southern
   Ocean feeding areas for Oceania humpback whales as well as the key
   environmental drivers affecting whale behavior. We detected behavioral
   differences between whales utilizing the two adjacent feeding regions
   (similar to 2000 km apart), which were likely caused by animals trying
   to efficiently locate prey in relation to the dynamic environmental
   characteristics of each habitat. We observed a seasonal pattern in
   foraging behavior, with the peak occurring in the middle of summer.
   Whales also foraged more intensively with increasing proximity to areas
   from which the ice edge had recently retreated, suggesting heightened
   productivity in these areas. The relationship between the animals and
   the physical features of the seascape, as well as the behavioral
   plasticity observed, could have implications for the future recovery of
   these whales in a changing Southern Ocean.},

Title = {Resistance to starvation in settling spiny lobsters in warming coastal
   waters},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {623},

Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Spiny lobsters have an extended larval development in offshore waters
   that ends with the non-feeding post-larvae swimming across the
   continental shelf and settling in shallow coastal waters. We tested the
   hypothesis that recent declines in the recruitment of a number of spiny
   lobster populations in different parts of the world are the result of
   increasing coastal water temperatures that deplete the metabolic
   reserves of recently settled post-larvae. We examined the resilience of
   recently settled juvenile lobsters to the depletion of their reserves in
   2 species of spiny lobster from temperate waters. Juveniles of Jasus
   edwardsii survived on average (+/- SE) for 34.44 +/- 3.44 d without
   feeding at 19-21 degrees C, while Sagmariasus verreauxi survived for
   39.96 +/- 1.40 d, with no differences in survival among 3 temperature
   regimes (17, 20 and 23 degrees C). The point of no return for
   recently-settled juveniles of S. verreauxi was estimated to be 30.40 +/-
   13.50 d, which was close to their average survival under starvation
   conditions. Starved juvenile lobsters close to the point of no return
   with extremely low remaining protein and lipid (6.52\% lipid and 27.18\%
   protein of dry body mass) were capable of surviving once food was
   supplied. These results indicate that newly settled juveniles of spiny
   lobsters from temperate waters can endure adverse nutritional conditions
   over a wide range of thermal conditions for prolonged periods, making
   them resilient to future increases in water temperatures as a result of
   climate change.},

Title = {Habitat partitioning in Antarctic krill: Spawning hotspots and nursery
   areas},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, have a circumpolar distribution but
   are concentrated within the south-west Atlantic sector, where they
   support a unique food web and a commercial fishery. Within this sector,
   our first goal was to produce quantitative distribution maps of all six
   ontogenetic life stages of krill (eggs, nauplii plus metanauplii,
   calyptopes, furcilia, juveniles, and adults), based on a compilation of
   all available post 1970s data. Using these maps, we then examined
   firstly whether ``hotspots{''} of egg production and early stage nursery
   occurred, and secondly whether the available habitat was partitioned
   between the successive life stages during the austral summer and autumn,
   when krill densities can be high. To address these questions, we
   compiled larval krill density records and extracted data spanning 41
   years (1976-2016) from the existing KRILLBASE-abundance and
   KRILLBASE-length-frequency databases. Although adult males and females
   of spawning age were widely distributed, the distribution of eggs,
   nauplii and metanauplii indicates that spawning is most intense over the
   shelf and shelf slope. This contrasts with the distributions of
   calyptope and furcilia larvae, which were concentrated further offshore,
   mainly in the Southern Scotia Sea. Juveniles, however, were strongly
   concentrated over shelves along the Scotia Arc. Simple environmental
   analyses based on water depth and mean water temperature suggest that
   krill associate with different habitats over the course of their life
   cycle. From the early to late part of the austral season, juvenile
   distribution moves from ocean to shelf, opposite in direction to that
   for adults. Such habitat partitioning may reduce intraspecific
   competition for food, which has been suggested to occur when densities
   are exceptionally high during years of strong recruitment. It also
   prevents any potential cannibalism by adults on younger stages.
   Understanding the location of krill spawning and juvenile development in
   relation to potentially overlapping fishing activities is needed to
   protect the health of the south-west Atlantic sector ecosystem.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1263-1281},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Historical harvesting pushed many whale species to the brink of
   extinction. Although most Southern Hemisphere populations are slowly
   recovering, the influence of future climate change on their recovery
   remains unknown. We investigate the impacts of two anthropogenic
   pressures-historical commercial whaling and future climate change-on
   populations of baleen whales (blue, fin, humpback, Antarctic minke,
   southern right) and their prey (krill and copepods) in the Southern
   Ocean. We use a climate-biological coupled ``Model of Intermediate
   Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments{''} (MICE) that links krill and
   whale population dynamics with climate change drivers, including changes
   in ocean temperature, primary productivity and sea ice. Models predict
   negative future impacts of climate change on krill and all whale
   species, although the magnitude of impacts on whales differs among
   populations. Despite initial recovery from historical whaling, models
   predict concerning declines under climate change, even local extinctions
   by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue, fin and southern right whales,
   and Atlantic/Indian fin and humpback whales. Predicted declines were a
   consequence of reduced prey (copepods/krill) from warming and increasing
   interspecific competition between whale species. We model whale
   population recovery under an alternative scenario whereby whales adapt
   their migratory patterns to accommodate changing sea ice in the
   Antarctic and a shifting prey base. Plasticity in range size and
   migration was predicted to improve recovery for ice-associated blue and
   minke whales. Our study highlights the need for ongoing protection to
   help depleted whale populations recover, as well as local management to
   ensure the krill prey base remains viable, but this may have limited
   success without immediate action to reduce emissions.},

Abstract = {Total and organic mercury concentrations were determined for males,
   females and juveniles of Euphausia superba collected at three discrete
   locations in the Scotia Sea (South Orkney Islands, South Georgia and
   Antarctic Polar Front) to assess spatial mercury variability in
   Antarctic krill. There was clear geographic differentiation in mercury
   concentrations, with specimens from the South Orkney Islands having
   total mercury concentrations 5 to 7 times higher than Antarctic krill
   from South Georgia and the Antarctic Polar Front. Mercury did not appear
   to accumulate with life-stage since juveniles had higher concentrations
   of total mercury (0.071 mu g g(-1) from South Orkney Islands; 0.014 mu g
   g(-1) from South Georgia) than adults (0.054 mu g g(-1) in females and
   0.048 mu g g(-1) in males from South Orkney Islands; 0.006 mu g g(-1) in
   females and 0.007 mu g g(-1) in males from South Georgia). Results
   suggest that females may use egg laying as a mechanism to excrete
   mercury, with eggs having higher concentrations than the corresponding
   somatic tissue. Organic mercury makes up a minor percentage of total
   mercury (15-37\%) with the percentage being greater in adults than in
   juveniles. When compared to euphausiids from other parts of the world,
   the concentration of mercury in Antarctic krill is within the same
   range, or higher, highlighting the global distribution of this
   contaminant. Given the high potential for biomagnification of mercury
   through food webs, concentrations in Antarctic krill may have
   deleterious effects on long-lived Antarctic krill predators. (C) 2019

Title = {Antarctic Krill Are Reservoirs for Distinct Southern Ocean Microbial
   Communities},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Host-associated bacterial communities have received limited attention in
   polar habitats, but are likely to represent distinct nutrient-rich
   niches compared to the surrounding environment. Antarctic krill
   (Euphausia superba) are a super-abundant species with a circumpolar
   distribution, and the krill microbiome may make a substantial
   contribution to marine bacterial diversity in the Southern Ocean. We
   used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene
   to characterize bacterial diversity in seawater and krill tissue samples
   from four locations south of the Kerguelen Plateau, one of the most
   productive regions in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean.
   Krill-associated bacterial communities were distinct from those of the
   surrounding seawater, with different communities inhabiting the moults,
   digestive tract and faecal pellets, including several phyla not detected
   in the surrounding seawater. Digestive tissues from many individuals
   contained a potential gut symbiont (order: Mycoplasmoidales) shown to
   improve survival on a low quality diet in other crustaceans. Antarctic
   krill swarms thus influence Southern Ocean microbial communities not
   only through top-down grazing of eukaryotic cells and release of
   nutrients into the water column, but also by transporting distinct
   microbial assemblages horizontally via migration and vertically via
   sinking faecal pellets and moulted exuviae. Changes to Antarctic krill
   demographics or distribution through fishing pressure or climate-induced
   range shifts will also influence the composition and dispersal of
   Southern Ocean microbial communities.},

Title = {Adapting the dynamic energy budget (DEB) approach to include

Abstract = {Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory offers a comprehensive framework for
   understanding the overall physiological performance (growth,
   development, respiration, reproduction, etc.) of an organism over the
   course of its life cycle. We present here a simplified DEB model for the
   swimming crab Liocarcinus depurator. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first to be presented for this species. Most applications of the
   standard DEB model assume continuous growth in all size metrics (length,
   wet mass, carbon content) of the modelled species. However, in
   crustaceans growth, measured as an increase of carapace length/width,
   occurs periodically via moult. To account for this, we have extended the
   model to track the continuous increase in carbon mass as well as the
   episodic increase in physical size. Model predictions were consistent
   with the patterns in the observed data, predicting both the moult
   increment and the intermoult period of an individual. In addition to
   presenting the model itself, we also make recommendations for further
   development, and evaluate the potential applications of such a model,
   both at the individual level (e.g. aquaculture) and as a potential tool
   for population level dynamics (e.g. fisheries stock assessment).},

Volume = {76},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Krill overwintering strategies vary with ontogeny and year;
   understanding this variability is essential to predicting how the
   species will respond to climate change in the future. Overwintering
   studies have focused on larval and adult krill, but we know little about
   how juvenile krill overwinter. The late winter diet of juvenile krill is
   important because it will determine their growth and development rates
   and consequently their reproductive potential the following spring. A
   diet rich in ice algae would promote growth and reproductive
   development. The Bransfield Strait (northern Antarctic Peninsula, AP) is
   an important overwintering ground for krill; it has been proposed this
   region offers a food-rich winter environment. We examined the
   contribution of ice algae to the energy budget of overwintering juvenile
   krill during 2 years with contrasting sea ice conditions. Grazing on ice
   algae contributed approximate to 146\% to their winter energy budget in
   2015, even though ice concentrations were 50\% and consisted of newly
   formed pancake ice. However, when sea ice advanced late in the
   Bransfield Strait (2016), ice algae contributed significantly less
   (approximate to 16\%) to the winter energy budget of juvenile krill.
   Delayed sea ice advance may negatively affect growth and reproductive
   development of overwintering juvenile krill.},

Title = {Water temperature correlates with baleen whale foraging behaviour at
   multiple scales in the Antarctic},
Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-32},
Abstract = {How baleen whales locate prey and how environmental change may influence
   whale foraging success are not well understood. Baleen whale foraging
   habitat has largely been described at a population level, yet population
   responses to change are the result of individual strategies across
   multiple scales. This study aimed to determine how the foraging
   behaviour of individual whales varied relative to environmental
   conditions along their movement path. Biotelemetry devices provided
   information on humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) movement at two
   spatial scales in East Antarctica, and a mixed modelling approach was
   used at a medium scale (tens of kilometres) to determine which
   environmental factors correlated with a change in foraging behaviour.
   Water temperature was linked to a change in foraging behaviour at both
   spatial scales. At the medium scale, warmer water was associated with
   the resident state, commonly assumed to represent periods of foraging
   behaviour. However, fine-scale analyses suggested that cooler water was
   associated with a higher feeding rate. Variation in whale foraging
   behaviour with changes in water temperature adds support to the
   hypothesis that whales may be able to track environmental conditions to
   find prey. Future research should investigate this pattern further,
   given the predicted rise in water temperatures under climate-change
   scenarios.},

Title = {Using habitat models for chinstrap penguins Pygoscelis antarctica to

Abstract = {Aim To predict the at-sea distribution of chinstrap penguins across the
   South Orkney Islands and to quantify the overlap with the Southern Ocean
   krill fishery. Location Methods South Orkney Islands, Antarctica.
   Penguins from four colonies across the South Orkney Islands were tracked
   using global positioning systems (GPSs) and time depth recorders (TDRs).
   Relationships between a variety of environmental and geometric variables
   and the at-sea distribution of penguins were investigated using general
   additive models for the three main phases of the breeding season.
   Subsequently, the final models were extrapolated across the South Orkney
   archipelago to predict the at-sea distribution of penguins from colonies
   where no tracking data are available. Finally, the overlap between areas
   used by chinstrap penguins and the krill fishery was quantified. Results
   Main conclusions The foraging distribution of chinstrap penguins can be
   predicted using two simple and static variables: the distance from the
   colony and the direction of travel towards the shelf-edge, while
   avoiding high densities of Pygoscelis penguins from other colonies.
   Additionally, we find that the chinstrap penguins breeding on the South
   Orkney Islands use areas which overlap with frequently used krill
   fishing areas and that this overlap is most prominent during the brood
   and creche phases of the breeding season. This is the first step in
   understanding the potential impacts of the krill fishery, for all
   colonies including those where no empirical tracking data are available.
   However, with the available data, it is not currently possible to infer
   an impact of the krill fisheries on penguins. With this in mind, we
   recommend the implementation of monitoring schemes to investigate the
   effects of prey depletion on predator populations and to ensure that
   management continues to follow a precautionary approach and is addressed
   at spatial and temporal scales relevant to ecosystem operation.},

Title = {Modelling the life cycle of Salpa thompsoni},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {387},
Pages = {17-26},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Salpa thompsoni is an important grazer in the Southern Ocean. It is
   found from the Subtropical Convergence southward to the coastal
   Antarctic Seas but being most abundant in the Antarctic Polar Frontal
   Zone. Low temperatures appear to negatively affect their development,
   limiting their ability to occur in the krill dominated high Antarctic
   ecosystems. Yet reports indicate that with ocean warming S. thompsoni
   have experienced a southward shift in their distribution. As they are
   efficient filter feeders, this shift can result in large-scale changes
   in the Southern Ocean ecosystem by increasing competitive or predatory
   interactions with Antarctic krill. To explore salp bloom dynamics in the
   Southern Ocean a size-structured S. thompsoni population model was
   developed with growth, consumption, reproduction and mortality rates
   dependent on temperature and chlorophyll a conditions. The largest
   uncertainties in S. thompsoni population ecology are individual and
   population growth rates, with a recent study identifying the possibility
   that the life cycle could be much shorter than previously considered.
   Here we run a suite of hypothesis scenarios under various environmental
   conditions to determine the most appropriate growth rate. Temperature
   and chlorophyll a were sufficient drivers to recreate seasonal and
   interannual dynamics of salp populations at two locations. The most
   suitable growth model suggests that mean S. thompsoni growth rates are
   likely to be similar to 1 mm body length d(-1), 2-fold higher than
   previous calculations. S. thompsoni biomass was dependent on bud release
   time, with larger biomass years corresponding to bud release occurring
   during favorable environmental conditions; increasing the survival and
   growth of blastozooids and resulting in higher embryo release. This
   model confirms that it is necessary for growth and reproductive rates to
   be flexible in order for the salp population to adapt to varying
   environmental conditions and provides a framework that can examine how
   future salp populations might respond to climate change.},

Abstract = {Light regime is an important zeitgeber for Antarctic krill (Euphausia
   superba Dana, 1850), which seems to entrain an endogenous timing system
   that synchronizes its life cycle to the extreme light conditions in the
   Southern Ocean. To understand the flexibility of Antarctic krill's
   seasonal cycle, we investigated its physiological and behavioural
   responses to different light regimes and if an endogenous timing system
   was involved in the regulation of these seasonal processes. We analysed
   growth, feeding, lipid content, and maturity in a 2-year laboratory
   experiment simulating the latitudinal light regimes at 52 degrees S and
   66 degrees S and constant darkness under constant food level. Our
   results showed that light regime affected seasonal cycles of growth,
   feeding, lipid metabolism, and maturity in Antarctic krill. Seasonal
   patterns of growth, feeding, and maturity persisted under constant
   darkness, indicating the presence of an endogenous timing system. The
   maturity cycle showed differences in critical photoperiods according to
   the simulated latitudinal light regime. This suggests a flexible
   endogenous timing mechanism in Antarctic krill, which may determine its
   response to future environmental changes.},

Abstract = {Information is needed on how anomalous environmental conditions affect
   important Antarctic ecological sentinels during the winter. Using a
   non-invasive method (scats), the diet of non-breeding gentoo penguins
   Pygoscelis papua at Bird Island, South Georgia, was examined during the
   winter of 2009 when local environmental conditions were abnormal (e.g.
   warmer sea surface waters). Scats were collected every 2 weeks from May
   until October 2009 (N = 168); the diet was dominated by the amphipod
   Themisto gaudichaudii by frequency of occurrence (77.5\% of the samples)
   and by number (70.5\% of the total individuals). By mass, different
   species of crustaceans (T. gaudichaudii and Antarctic krill Euphausia
   superba) and fish (Champsocephalus gunnari, Lepidonotothen larseni and
   Pseudochaenichthys georgianus) were the most important in different
   periods. Numerically, prey switching occurred at the end of winter, when
   E. superba became more abundant in the penguins' diets in late September
   and early October (austral spring), when sea surface temperatures became
   colder. T. gaudichaudii is sub-optimal prey for gentoo penguins and its
   consumption most likely reflects a lack of E. superba in local waters.
   The consumption of T. gaudichaudii and fish, in place of E. superba, was
   probably insufficient for the penguins to maintain a body condition
   suitable for reproduction, contributing to the observed late
   commencement of breeding (i.e. 2-3 weeks) that year. Our results
   highlight the sensitivity of gentoo penguin populations to variations in
   environmental conditions, particularly in terms of how these conditions
   affect the availability of preferred dietary items and potential
   follow-on effects in the subsequent breeding season.},

Title = {Dependency of Antarctic zooplankton species on ice algae-produced carbon

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {How the abundant pelagic life of the Southern Ocean survives winter
   darkness, when the sea is covered by pack ice and phytoplankton
   production is nearly zero, is poorly understood. Ice-associated
   (sympagic) microalgae could serve as a high-quality carbon source during
   winter, but their significance in the food web is so far unquantified.
   To better understand the importance of ice algae-produced carbon for the
   overwintering of Antarctic organisms, we investigated fatty acid (FA)
   and stable isotope compositions of 10 zooplankton species, and their
   potential sympagic and pelagic carbon sources. FA-specific carbon stable
   isotope compositions were used in stable isotope mixing models to
   quantify the contribution of ice algae-produced carbon ((Ice)) to the
   body carbon of each species. Mean (Ice) estimates ranged from 4\% to
   67\%, with large variations between species and depending on the FA used
   for the modelling. Integrating the (Ice) estimates from all models, the
   sympagic amphipod Eusirus laticarpus was the most dependent on ice algal
   carbon ((Ice): 54\%-67\%), and the salp Salpa thompsoni showed the least
   dependency on ice algal carbon ((Ice): 8\%-40\%). Differences in (Ice)
   estimates between FAs associated with short-term vs. long-term lipid
   pools suggested an increasing importance of ice algal carbon for many
   species as the winter season progressed. In the abundant winter-active
   copepod Calanus propinquus, mean (Ice) reached more than 50\% in late
   winter. The trophic carbon flux from ice algae into this copepod was
   between 3 and 5mgCm(-2)day(-1). This indicates that copepods and other
   ice-dependent zooplankton species transfer significant amounts of carbon
   from ice algae into the pelagic system, where it fuels the food web, the
   biological carbon pump and elemental cycling. Understanding the role of
   ice algae-produced carbon in these processes will be the key to
   predictions of the impact of future sea ice decline on Antarctic
   ecosystem functioning.},

Title = {Managing fishery development in sensitive ecosystems: identifying
   penguin habitat use to direct management in Antarctica},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {In the Southern Ocean, the at-sea distributions of most predators of
   Antarctic krill are poorly known, primarily because tracking studies
   have only been undertaken on a restricted set of species, and then only
   at a limited number of sites. For chinstrap penguins, one of the most
   abundant krill predators breeding across the Antarctic Peninsula, we
   show that habitat models developed utilizing the distance from the
   colony and the bearing to the shelf-edge, adjusting for the at-sea
   density of Pygoscelis penguins from other colonies, can be used to
   predict, with a high level of confidence, the at-sea distribution of
   chinstrap penguins from untracked colonies during the breeding season.
   Comparison of predicted penguin distributions with outputs from a
   high-resolution oceanographic model shows that chinstrap penguins prefer
   nearshore habitats, over shallow bathymetry, with slow-flowing waters,
   but that they sometimes also travel to areas beyond the edge of the
   continental shelf where the faster-flowing waters of the Coastal Current
   or the fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current occur. In the
   slow-moving shelf waters, large penguin colonies may lead to krill
   depletion during incubation and chick-rearing periods when penguins are
   acting as central place foragers. The habitats used by chinstrap
   penguins are also locations preferentially used by the commercial krill
   fishery, one of the last under-developed marine capture fisheries
   anywhere on the planet. As it develops, this fishery has the potential
   to compete with chinstrap penguins and other natural krill predators.
   Scaling our habitat models by chinstrap penguin population data
   demonstrates where overlap with the fishery is likely to be most
   important. Our results suggest that a better understanding of krill
   retention and krill depletion in areas used by natural predators and by
   the krill fishery are needed, and that risk management strategies for
   the fishery should include assessment of how krill movement can satisfy
   the demands of both natural predators and the fishery across a range of
   spatial and temporal scales. Such information will help regional
   management authorities better understand how plausible ecosystem-based
   management frameworks could be developed to ensure sustainable
   co-existence of the fishery and competing natural predators.},

Abstract = {Open ocean predator-prey interactions are often difficult to interpret
   because of a lack of information on prey fields at scales relevant to
   predator behaviour. Hence, there is strong interest in identifying the
   biological and physical factors influencing the distribution and
   abundance of prey species, which may be of broad predictive use for
   conservation planning and evaluating effects of environmental change.
   This study focuses on a key Southern Ocean prey species, Antarctic krill
   Euphausia superba, using acoustic observations of individual swarms
   (aggregations) from a large-scale survey off East Antarctica. We
   developed two sets of statistical models describing swarm
   characteristics, one set using underway survey data for the explanatory
   variables, and the other using their satellite remotely sensed
   analogues. While survey data are in situ and contemporaneous with the
   swarm data, remotely sensed data are all that is available for
   prediction and inference about prey distribution in other areas or at
   other times. The fitted models showed that the primary biophysical
   influences on krill swarm characteristics included daylight (solar
   elevation/radiation) and proximity to the Antarctic continental slope,
   but there were also complex relationships with current velocities and
   gradients. Overall model performance was similar regardless of whether
   underway or remotely sensed predictors were used. We applied the latter
   models to generate regional-scale spatial predictions using a 10-yr
   remotely-sensed time series. This retrospective modelling identified
   areas off east Antarctica where relatively dense krill swarms were
   consistently predicted during austral mid-summers, which may underpin
   key foraging areas for marine predators. Spatiotemporal predictions
   along Antarctic predator satellite tracks, from independent studies,
   illustrate the potential for uptake into further quantitative modelling
   of predator movements and foraging. The approach is widely applicable to
   other krill-dependent ecosystems, and our findings are relevant to
   similar efforts examining biophysical linkages elsewhere in the Southern
   Ocean and beyond.},

Abstract = {In the present study we used stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen
   (delta N-15) analysis of whiskers to investigate the isotopic niche
   overlap and partition among three pack ice seals sampled along the Danco
   Coast, Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Isotopic values in serially
   sampled whiskers of 34 leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx, HL), 13 crabeater
   (Lobodon carcinophaga, LC) and 14 Weddell (Leptonychotes weddellii, LW)
   seals were measured. Two clusters of leopard seals were identified based
   on their delta N-15 values: a high-trophic level group (HLhigh) and a
   low-trophic level group (HLlow). Overlap in SEAc was only seen between
   HL and LC, while HL and LW showed an overlap in their convex hulls, but
   no overlap in SEAc. Diet compositions estimated using Bayesian stable
   isotope mixing models revealed intra- and interspecific differences
   among seals. For leopard seals highest dietary contributor was krill,
   while for HLhigh krill and fish cephalopod were the main contributors.
   Mixing models run separately for each HL seal showed a large variation
   in the proportional contribution of krill (12-90\%) compared to the
   other sources (cephalopods, fish, penguins and seals). The crabeater
   seals almost exclusively consumed krill, with a low contribution of the
   other prey. Weddell seals, on the other hand, showed a high proportion
   of fish and a lower contribution of cephalopods and penguins, while the
   contribution of krill seemed to be minimal. This study is the first to
   compare isotopic niches of three Antarctic seals from the WAP. Our
   results indicate that crabeater and leopard seals seem to have a strong
   and a considerable dependence on krill, respectively. Although the WAP
   is characterized by an unusually high production of Antarctic krill the
   large community of vertebrate predators that feed upon this resource
   (penguins, seals and baleen whales) should be especially vulnerable
   under future scenarios of reduction of krill biomass. Under the current
   drastic environmental changes in the WAP, continuing to monitor WAP seal
   diets and the relative contribution of krill to them will help
   understand the degree to which climate change may alter the population
   dynamics of these upper trophic level species.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {588},

Abstract = {Climate change is predicted to affect Southern Ocean biota in complex
   ways. Euphausiids play a crucial role in the trophodynamics of the
   ecosystem, and their status under future environmental scenarios is the
   subject of much concern. Thysanoessa macrura is the most widely
   distributed, numerically abundant, and ubiquitous euphausiid south of
   the Polar Front and may be an underappreciated prey species. T. macrura
   is eurythermic and may be better able to tolerate warming ocean
   temperatures in comparison to the more stenothermic Antarctic krill
   Euphausia superba. We use temperature-dependent growth models and
   biomass per recruit to investigate how the availability of this
   euphausiid to predators may change under a range of temperature
   scenarios. We contrast this with the availability of E. superba and find
   that, under some ranges of temperature change, increasing T. macrura
   growth may be able to partially compensate for decreasing E. superba
   growth in terms of biomass available for predators. However, in spite of
   its considerable biomass, other aspects of this species, such as its
   size and habitat, may limit its potential to replace E. superba in the
   diet of many predators.},

Title = {Impacts of rising sea temperature on krill increase risks for predators
   in the Scotia Sea},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Climate change is a threat to marine ecosystems and the services they
   provide, and reducing fishing pressure is one option for mitigating the
   overall consequences for marine biota. We used a minimally realistic
   ecosystem model to examine how projected effects of ocean warming on the
   growth of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, might affect populations
   of krill and dependent predators (whales, penguins, seals, and fish) in
   the Scotia Sea. We also investigated the potential to mitigate depletion
   risk for predators by curtailing krill fishing at different points in
   the 21st century. The projected effects of ocean warming on krill
   biomass were strongest in the northern Scotia Sea, with a >= 40\%
   decline in the mass of individual krill. Projections also suggest a 25\%
   chance that krill biomass will fall below an established depletion
   threshold (75\% of its unimpacted level), with consequent risks for some
   predator populations, especially penguins. Average penguin abundance
   declined by up to 30\% of its unimpacted level, with up to a 50\% chance
   of falling below the depletion threshold. Simulated krill fishing at
   currently permitted harvest rates further increased risks for depletion,
   and stopping fishing offset the increased risks associated with ocean
   warming in our model to some extent. These results varied by location
   and species group. Risk reductions at smaller spatial scales also
   differed from those at the regional level, which suggests that some
   predator populations may be more vulnerable than others to future
   changes in krill biomass. However, impacts on predators did not always
   map directly to those for krill. Our findings indicate the importance of
   identifying vulnerable marine populations and targeting protection
   measures at appropriate spatial scales, and the potential for
   spatially-structured management to avoid aggravating risks associated
   with rising ocean temperatures. This may help balance tradeoffs among
   marine ecosystem services in an uncertain future.},

Title = {Distribution of Phaeocystis antarctica-dominated sea ice algal
   communities and their potential to seed phytoplankton across the western
   Antarctic Peninsula in spring},

Volume = {586},

Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {The western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced extreme changes in the
   timing of sea ice melt and freeze up, shortening the duration of the
   seasonal sea ice cycle. While previous research demonstrated connections
   between multiple pelagic trophic levels and the physics of the sea ice,
   few studies have assessed the sea ice ecosystem or its linkage to the
   ocean ecosystem in this region. Through a field survey and shipboard
   experiments, our study focused on characterizing the spring ice algal
   bloom and elucidating its role in seeding phytoplankton communities
   postice melt in high and low light conditions. Field data revealed that
   algal communities in slush layers, often formed from the flooding of
   seawater (infiltration layers), dominated biomass distributions in the
   sea ice throughout the region, and showed distinct photophysiological
   characteristics from interior or bottom ice communities. Sea ice algal
   biomass reached 120 mg chl a m(-2) and was often dominated by
   Phaeocystis antarctica. Shipboard growth experiments showed that prior
   light history (ice or water column), rather than community composition
   (phytoplankton and ice algae were composed of similar taxa), primarily
   drove physiological responses to high and low light. P. antarctica
   generally dominated the community in growth experiments at the end of
   the 6 d incubation period. Settling column experiments suggested that P.
   antarctica's higher sinking rates relative to other taxa may explain its
   minor contributions to the summer phytoplankton community in single-cell
   form and its absence in colonial form, observed in the long-term
   ecological record of this region.},

Title = {Adult Antarctic krill proves resilient in a simulated high CO2 ocean},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) have a keystone role in the Southern
   Ocean, as the primary prey of Antarctic predators. Decreases in krill
   abundance could result in a major ecological regime shift, but there is
   limited information on how climate change may affect krill. Increasing
   anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are causing ocean
   acidification, as absorption of atmospheric CO2 in seawater alters ocean
   chemistry. Ocean acidification increases mortality and negatively
   affects physiological functioning in some marine invertebrates, and is
   predicted to occur most rapidly at high latitudes. Here we show that, in
   the laboratory, adult krill are able to survive, grow, store fat,
   mature, and maintain respiration rates when exposed to near-future ocean
   acidification (1000-2000 mu atm pCO(2)) for one year. Despite
   differences in seawater pCO(2) incubation conditions, adult krill are
   able to actively maintain the acid-base balance of their body fluids in
   near-future pCO(2), which enhances their resilience to ocean
   acidification.},

Title = {Ecosystem modelling to quantify the impact of historical whaling on

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Many baleen whales were commercially harvested during the 20th century
   almost to extinction. Reliable assessments of how this mass depletion
   impacted whale populations, and projections of their recovery, are
   crucial but there are uncertainties regarding the status of Southern
   Hemisphere whale populations. We developed a Southern Hemisphere spatial
   Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments (MICE) for
   phytoplankton, krill (Euphausia superba) and five baleen whale species,
   to estimate whale population trajectories from 1890 to present. To
   forward project to 2100, we couple the predator-prey model to a global
   climate model. We used the most up to date catch records, fitted to
   survey data and accounted for key uncertainties. We predict Antarctic
   blue (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia), fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and
   southern right (Eubalaena australis) whales will be at less than half
   their pre-exploitation numbers (K) even given 100years of future
   protection from whaling, because of slow growth rates. Some species have
   benefited greatly from cessation of harvesting, particularly humpbacks
   (Megaptera novaeangliae), currently at 32\% of K, with full recovery
   predicted by 2050. We highlight spatial differences in the recovery of
   whale species between oceanic areas, with current estimates of
   Atlantic/Indian area blue (1,890, <1\% of K) and fin (16,950, <4\% of K)
   whales suggesting slower recovery from harvesting, whilst Pacific
   southern right numbers are <7\% of K (2,680). Antarctic minke
   (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) population trajectories track future expected
   increases in primary productivity. Population estimates and plausible
   future predicted trajectories for Southern Hemisphere baleen whales are
   key requirements for management and conservation.},

Title = {IMPLICATIONS OF LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE FOR BIOGEOGRAPHY AND ECOLOGICAL
   PROCESSES IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN},
Booktitle = {OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY: AN ANNUAL REVIEW, VOL 56},
Series = {Oceanography and Marine Biology},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {1-71},
Abstract = {Understanding the long-term consequences of climate change for Southern
   Ocean ecosystems is important because this is one of the last remaining
   wildernesses on the planet and because the Southern Ocean is a major
   driver of global climate. The Southern Ocean is roughly the size of
   Africa and experiences exceptional seasonality. Its many habitats
   include the permanently open ocean, sea ice, frontal systems and neritic
   waters, and different zonal (east-west) and meridional (north-south)
   regions are on different trajectories in terms of climate, sea ice cover
   and biological populations. The Western Antarctic Peninsula has
   experienced substantial warming, loss of sea ice and declining Adelie
   penguin populations, while eastern Antarctica has cooled, shown
   increased ice cover and increasing numbers of Adelies. In the ocean
   itself, warming seems to be concentrated north of the Antarctic
   Circumpolar Current and at depth rather than in surface waters.
   Densities of Antarctic krill are correlated with ice cover in the
   previous winter and in the south-west Atlantic have decreased over the
   last century while salps have shown increasing numbers south of the
   Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Even in this example, the mechanisms
   involved are uncertain, making predictions difficult.
   The historic loss of an enormous biomass of consumers through fisheries,
   led to top- down ecological effects including competitive release among
   predators. These pelagic food webs are, however, strongly physically
   forced, making them particularly vulnerable to changes in environmental
   conditions. The size and species composition of the primary producers
   affect food chain length and the efficiency of the biological pump.
   Critically, the primary producer community is profoundly shaped by
   factors influencing the availability of light (e.g. season, ice melt and
   water column stability), micro and macronutrients. Changes in these will
   have deeply important bottom-up effects, and this brings us to defining
   biogeography. In these pelagic systems, biogeographic provinces are
   defined by the frontal systems that delineate sharp discontinuities in
   conditions in the water column and the taxa that dominate primary
   production. Because these are not geographically fixed, changes in
   biogeography in this context describe the expansion, contraction or
   simple displacement of biomes. The associated food webs revolve around a
   small number of key species that differ among habitats and biomes. They
   are not simple, exhibit considerable flexibility and include a number of
   taxa, particularly the cephalopods, that are difficult to sample and
   remain poorly studied. A major difficulty in understanding how climate
   change is likely to manifest is the brevity of relevant datasets. We
   have few physical or biological benchmarks to use in separating
   short-term noise from long-term signal. As a physical example, Southern
   Ocean fronts can exhibit short-term meridional shifts of >100 km in a
   matter of weeks. Biologically, regional differences in trajectories of
   Adelie penguin numbers need to be viewed against the background of
   substantial variability over the last 45,000 years. Except for ice or
   sediment cores, such data are available for few variables or species. In
   addition, research efforts are geographically unbalanced for logistic
   reasons. Remote sensing and the Argo float programme reduce this problem
   by increasing spatial coverage enormously for some variables, but not
   others, and even then offer relatively new time series.
   Important variables that are undergoing, or will undergo, change
   include: sea ice cover (essentially habitat loss), sea temperatures,
   wind and mixing regimes, the positions of fronts, ultraviolet levels and
   ocean pH. Many of these will have interacting effects, and the areas
   likely to be exposed to multiple environmental changes far exceed those
   already experiencing important changes. Species are potentially
   vulnerable to stressors at all ontogenetic stages and in many cases
   sublethal effects (e.g. on reproductive success) are likely to affect
   population dynamics before stressors reach lethal levels. Likely, and
   complicated, will be possible changes to the microbial plankton,
   including increased microbe deposition by aeolian dust and greater
   susceptibility of potential hosts to viral infection because of other
   stresses. All these stressors can have direct and interacting effects as
   well as indirect effects. For example, meridional shifts in frontal
   positions will alter the foraging ranges of top predators that are
   land-based during the breeding season. The ecosystem-level consequences
   will depend on individual species reactions, including the rates at
   which they can respond and stressors to which they respond, with the
   potential disruption of species interactions through different
   phenological responses.
   Perhaps the key characteristic of predictions for the effects of climate
   change on the Southern Ocean lies in an even greater degree of
   uncertainty than the norm.},

Abstract = {Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, crystal krill E. crystallorophias,
   and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica are key mid-trophic
   level species in the Ross Sea, connecting primary production to the
   upper trophic levels. Distributions of these species were constructed
   from observations made in the western Ross Sea from 1988 to 2004.
   Distributions of environmental conditions were obtained from a 5-km
   resolution circulation model (temperature, mixed layer depth, surface
   speed) and satellite-derived observations (chlorophyll, sea ice cover).
   A hierarchy of statistical methods determined correlations and
   relationships between species and environmental conditions. Each species
   occupies a localized habitat defined by different environmental
   characteristics. Antarctic krill are concentrated along the northwestern
   shelf break in a habitat characterized by deep (>1000 m) bottom depth,
   warm temperature (1 to 1.25 degrees C), decreased sea ice, and proximity
   to the shelf break. Crystal krill and Antarctic silverfish are
   concentrated in Terra Nova Bay. Common characteristics of the habitat
   for these species are southwesterly location, coastal proximity, and
   cold temperature (-1.75 to -2 degrees C). The habitat characteristics
   obtained for the 3 species provide a basis for projecting potential
   distribution changes in response to environmental change and for
   delineating regions of the Ross Sea for focused management and selection
   of marine protected areas that support ecosystem-level conservation
   plans.},

Title = {Ecosystem Oceanography of Seabird Hotspots: Environmental Determinants
   and Relationship with Antarctic Krill Within an Important Fishing Ground},

Abstract = {The discipline of ecosystem oceanography provides a framework for
   assessing the role of mesoscale physical processes on the formation and
   occurrence of biological hotspots. We used shipboard surveys over nine
   years to investigate environmental determinants of seabird hotspots near
   the Antarctic Peninsula, a region experiencing rapid climate change and
   an expanding krill fishery. We hypothesize that seabird hotspots are
   structured by mesoscale ocean conditions that reflect differences in
   prey distribution within oceanic and coastal waters. We used generalized
   additive models to quantify functional relationships of seabird hotspots
   with krill biomass, and a suite of remotely sensed environmental
   variables, such as eddy kinetic energy. The spatial organization,
   changes in intensity, and distribution shifts of seabird hotspots
   indicate different environmental drivers within coastal and oceanic
   domains and reflect the seasonal variability of the ecosystem. Our
   results indicate at least eight mesoscale hotspot zones that represent
   ecologically important areas where significant krill and predator
   biomass may be concentrated. Our ecosystem assessment of seabird
   hotspots identified critical foraging habitat and provided reference
   points to benefit research on estimating their trophic impacts on
   Antarctic ecosystems and potential effects from the krill fishery. Our
   approach is generally applicable to other pelagic ecosystems that are
   structured by hydrographic fronts and eddies, and containing schooling
   forage species shared by multiple wide-ranging predators. Furthermore,
   identification of biological hotspots is useful for the designation of
   marine protected areas most critical to potentially endangered wildlife
   and fisheries resources.},

Title = {Restricted regions of enhanced growth of Antarctic krill in the
   circumpolar Southern Ocean},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {Food webs in high-latitude oceans are dominated by relatively few
   species. Future ocean and sea-ice changes affecting the distribution of
   such species will impact the structure and functioning of whole
   ecosystems. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species in
   Southern Ocean food webs, but there is little understanding of the
   factors influencing its success throughout much of the ocean. The
   capacity of a habitat to maintain growth will be crucial and here we use
   an empirical relationship of growth rate to assess seasonal spatial
   variability. Over much of the ocean, potential for growth is limited,
   with three restricted oceanic regions where seasonal conditions permit
   high growth rates, and only a few areas around the Scotia Sea and
   Antarctic Peninsula suitable for growth of the largest krill (> 60 mm).
   Our study demonstrates that projections of impacts of future change need
   to account for spatial and seasonal variability of key ecological
   processes within ocean ecosystems.},

Abstract = {While ocean acidification (OA) is expected to have wide-ranging negative
   effects on marine species, organisms currently living in variable pH
   environments that expose them intermittently to pH values approaching
   those predicted for the future, may be better adapted to tolerate
   prolonged exposure to high pCO(2) levels caused by OA. Seasonal
   upwelling brings low pH water to the surface along the Pacific Coast of
   North America. In Monterey Bay, California Euphausia pacifica, a key
   species supporting a diverse multi-trophic-level ecosystem, currently
   experiences broad pCO(2) and pH ranges due to both diel vertical
   migrations and seasonal upwelling. We determined tolerances of E.
   pacifica to prolonged exposure to pH levels predicted for 2100 by
   maintaining adults at two pCO(2) levels (380 and 1200 mu atm) for 2
   months. Rates of survival and moulting were the same at both pCO(2)
   levels. High pCO2 slowed growth in all size classes. In additional
   experiments to determine pCO2 threshold levels above which E. pacifica
   is adversely affected, survival was not affected down to pH 6.96 (6050
   mu atm), but declined rapidly at pH 6.92 (7228 mu atm) and lower, with
   100\% mortality within 10 d at pH 6.89.},

Title = {Overwinter habitat selection by Antarctic krill under varying sea-ice
   conditions: implications for top predators and fishery management},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {568},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Climate change will affect Antarctic krill Euphausia superba,
   krill-dependent predators, and fisheries in the Southern Ocean as areas
   typically covered by sea ice become ice-free in some winters. Research
   cruises conducted around the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic
   Peninsula during winters with contrasting ice conditions provide the
   first acoustic estimates of krill biomass, habitat use, and association
   with top predators to examine potential interactions with the krill
   fishery. Krill abundance was very low in offshore waters during all
   winters. In Bransfield Strait, median krill abundance was an order of
   magnitude higher (8 krill m(-2)) compared to summer (0.25 krill m(-2)),
   and this pattern was ob served in all winters regardless of ice cover.
   Acoustic estimates of krill biomass were also an order of magnitude
   higher (similar to 5 500 000 metric tons {[}t] in 2014) than a 15 yr
   summer average (520 000 t). Looking at krill-dependent predators, during
   winter, crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus were concentrated in
   Brans-field Strait where ice provided habitat, while Antarctic fur seals
   Arctocephalus gazella were more broadly distributed. Krill overwinter in
   coastal basin environments independent of ice and primary production and
   in an area that is becoming more frequently ice-free. While long-term
   projections of climate change have focused on changing krill habitat and
   productivity declines, more immediate impacts of ongoing climate change
   include increased risks of negative fishery-krill-predator interactions,
   alteration of upper trophic level community structure, and changes in
   the pelagic ecology of this system. Development of management strategies
   to mitigate the increased risk to krill populations and their dependent
   predators over management timescales will be necessary to minimize the
   impacts of long-term climate change.},

Abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) densities vary in space and time
   across multiple scales, with consequences for krill predators, the krill
   fishery, and management decisions. We use acoustic data collected from
   1997 to 2011 around the South Shetland Islands near the northern
   Antarctic Peninsula to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in krill
   biomass, distribution, and patchiness both within and across years.
   Moreover, we evaluate potential climate drivers of krill biomass and
   spatial organization through comparison with seasonally lagged climate
   indices. Krill abundance varied by an order of magnitude throughout the
   study period, with mean biomass ranging from a high of 171.9 g m(-2) in
   1997 to a low of 9.4 g m(-2) in 2002. We find that across years, krill
   abundance and variability are correlated with seasonally averaged
   measures of El Nio-Southern Oscillation at lags of approximately 2-2.5
   years, which may correspond to strong reproduction and recruitment
   events. Krill biomass shows generally weak to moderate spatial
   autocorrelation and high aggregation, with measures of spatial
   organization correlated with abundance in some habitats. Within years,
   there was an overall trend of declining krill abundance and/or
   detectability and contracted spatial distribution between midsummer and
   late summer, but this pattern was not consistent across all years. This
   synthesis provides the background to model krill prey landscapes in
   order to better understand regional foraging ecology of krill predators
   and fishery performance.},

Abstract = {Using known-age Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) grown from eggs
   hatched at two different laboratories, we validate the annual pattern of
   bands deposited in the eyestalks of krill and determine the absolute age
   of these animals. Ages two through five years were validated, and these
   animals ranged from 37.1 to 62.6 mm in total length. The band counts in
   these individuals were either identical to their absolute ages, or only
   failed to agree by a few months, which demonstrates the accuracy of this
   method. Precision and bias were estimated graphically using Chang's
   index (Coefficient of Variation = 5.03\%). High accuracy and precision
   between readers and low ageing bias indicate that longitudinal sections
   of eyestalks can be used to age krill in wild samples and to develop
   age-based stock assessment models for krill. Archival samples preserved
   in formalin (5\%) and stored in ambient conditions were also readable.
   Ageing preserved krill will provide the opportunity to examine changes
   in growth among krill populations within the Southern Ocean and to
   retrospectively examine changes in krill production over the last
   century to better understand the historical and future impacts of
   climate change on this critical Southern Ocean species.},

Title = {Ice Algae-Produced Carbon Is Critical for Overwintering of Antarctic
   Krill Euphausia superba},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Antarctic krill Euphausia superba ({''}krill{''}) constitute a
   fundamental food source for Antarctic seabirds and mammals, and a
   globally important fisheries resource. The future resilience of krill to
   climate change depends critically on the winter survival of young krill.
   To survive periods of extremely low production by pelagic algae during
   winter, krill are assumed to rely partly on carbon produced by ice
   algae. The true dependency on ice algae-produced carbon, however, is so
   far unquantified. This confounds predictions on the future resilience of
   krill stocks to sea ice decline. Fatty acid (FA) analysis, bulk stable
   isotope analysis (BSIA), and compound-specific stable isotope analysis
   (CSIA) of diatom- and dinoflagellate-associated marker FAs were applied
   to quantify the dependency of overwintering larval, juvenile, and adult
   krill on ice algae-produced carbon (alpha(ice)) during winter 2013 in
   the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone. Our results demonstrate that the
   majority of the carbon uptake of the overwintering larval and juvenile
   krill originated from ice algae (up to 88\% of the carbon budget), and
   that the dependency on ice algal carbon decreased with ontogeny,
   reaching 56\% of the carbon budget in adults. Spatio-temporal
   variability in the utilization of ice algal carbon was more pronounced
   in larvae and juvenile krill than in adults. Differences between uice
   estimates derived from short- vs. long-term FA-specific isotopic
   compositions suggested that ice algae-produced carbon gained importance
   as the winter progressed, and might become critical at the late
   winter-spring transition, before the phytoplankton bloom commences.
   Where the sea ice season shortens, reduced availability of ice algae
   might possibly not be compensated by surplus phytoplankton production
   during wintertime. Hence, sea ice decline could seriously endanger the
   winter survival of recruits, and subsequently overall biomass of krill.},

Title = {Zooplankton Gut Passage Mobilizes Lithogenic Iron for Ocean Productivity},

Pages = {2667-2673},

Abstract = {Iron is an essential nutrient for phytoplankton, but low concentrations
   limit primary production and associated atmospheric carbon drawdown in
   large parts of the world's oceans {[}1, 2]. Lithogenic particles
   deriving from aeolian dust deposition, glacial runoff, or river
   discharges can form an important source if the attached iron becomes
   dissolved and therefore bioavailable {[}3-5]. Acidic digestion by
   zooplankton is a potential mechanism for iron mobilization {[}6], but
   evidence is lacking. Here we show that Antarctic krill sampled near
   glacial outlets at the island of South Georgia (Southern Ocean) ingest
   large amounts of lithogenic particles and contain 3-fold higher iron
   concentrations in their muscle than specimens from offshore, which
   confirms mineral dissolution in their guts. About 90\% of the lithogenic
   and biogenic iron ingested by krill is passed into their fecal pellets,
   which contain 5-fold higher proportions of labile (reactive) iron than
   intact diatoms. The mobilized iron can be released in dissolved form
   directly from krill or via multiple pathways involving microbes, other
   zooplankton, and krill predators. This can deliver substantial amounts
   of bioavailable iron and contribute to the fertilization of coastal
   waters and the ocean beyond. In line with our findings, phytoplankton
   blooms downstream of South Georgia are more intensive and longer lasting
   during years with high krill abundance on-shelf. Thus, krill crop
   phytoplankton but boost new production via their nutrient supply.
   Understanding and quantifying iron mobilization by zooplankton is
   essential to predict ocean productivity in a warming climate where
   lithogenic iron inputs from deserts, glaciers, and rivers are increasing

Abstract = {Overwintering of larvae underneath Antarctic pack ice is a critical
   stage in the life cycle of Antarctic krill. However, there are no
   circumpolar assessments of available habitat for larval krill, making it
   difficult to evaluate how climate change may impact this life stage. We
   use outputs from a circumpolar sea ice model, together with a set of
   simple assumptions regarding key habitat features, to identify possible
   regions of larval krill habitat around Antarctica during winter. We
   assume that the location and suitability of habitat is determined by
   both food availability and three-dimensional complexity of the sea ice.
   A comparison of the combined area of these regions under current
   conditions with a warm climate scenario indicates that while total areal
   sea ice extent decreases, there is a consistently larger area of
   potential larval krill habitat under warm conditions. These findings
   suggest that decreases in sea ice extent may not necessarily be
   detrimental for krill populations.},

Abstract = {Reliable statements about variability and change in marine ecosystems
   and their underlying causes are needed to report on their status and to
   guide management. Here we use the Framework on Ocean Observing (FOO) to
   begin developing ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (eEOVs) for the
   Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). An eEOV is a defined biological
   or ecological quantity, which is derived from field observations,, and
   which contributes significantly to assessments of Southern Ocean
   ecosystems. Here, assessments are concerned with estimating status and
   trends in ecosystem properties, attribution of trends to causes, and
   predicting future trajectories. eEOVs should be feasible to collect at
   appropriate spatial and temporal scales and are useful to the extent
   that they contribute to direct estimation of trends and/or attribution,
   and/or development of ecological (statistical or simulation) models to
   support assessments. In this paper we outline the rationale, including
   establishing a set of criteria, for selecting eEOVs for the SOOS and
   develop a list of candidate eEOVs for further evaluation. Other than
   habitat variables, nine types of eEOVs for Southern Ocean taxa are
   identified within three classes: state (magnitude, genetic/species, size
   spectrum), predator-prey (diet, foraging range), and autecology
   (phenology, reproductive rate, individual growth rate, detritus). Most
   candidates for the suite of Southern Ocean taxa relate to state or diet.
   Candidate autecological eEOVs have not been developed other than for
   marine mammals and birds. We consider some of the spatial and temporal
   issues that will influence the adoption and use of eEOVs in an observing
   system in the Southern Ocean, noting that existing operations and
   platforms potentially provide coverage of the four main sectors of the
   region the East and West Pacific, Atlantic and Indian. Lastly, we
   discuss the importance of simulation modelling in helping with the
   design of the observing system in the long term. Regional boundary:

Abstract = {Climate change is rapidly shaping the living environment of the most
   abundant keystone species of the Antarctic marine food web, Antarctic
   krill. Projected future changes for the krill habitat include a
   sustained increase in ocean temperature and changes in sea ice and
   chlorophyll a. Here we investigate how these factors affect the early
   life history of krill and identify the regions around Antarctica where
   the impact will be greatest. Our tool is a temperature-dependent krill
   growth model forced by data from comprehensive greenhouse warming
   simulations. We find that by the year 2100 localized regions along the
   western Weddell Sea, isolated areas of the Indian Antarctic , and the
   Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea will support successful spawning habitats
   for krill. The failure of potentially successful spawning will have a
   strong impact on the already declining adult populations with
   consequences for the Antarctic marine food web, having both ecological
   and commercial ramifications.},

Title = {Effectiveness of social information used by seabirds searching for
   unpredictable and ephemeral prey},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1223-1234},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Understanding how seabirds and other central place foragers locate food
   resources represents a key step in predicting responses to changes in
   resource abundance and distribution. Where prey distributions are
   unpredictable and ephemeral, seabirds may gain up-to-date information by
   monitoring the direction of birds returning to the colony or by
   monitoring the foraging behavior of other birds through local
   enhancement. However, search strategies based on social information may
   require high population densities, raising concerns about the potential
   loss of information in declining populations. Our objectives were to
   explore the mechanisms that underpin effective search strategies based
   on social information under a range of population densities and
   different foraging conditions. Testing relevant hypotheses through field
   observation is challenging because of limitations in the ability to
   manipulate population densities and foraging conditions. We therefore
   developed a spatially explicit individual-based foraging model, informed
   by data on the movement and foraging patterns of seabirds foraging on
   pelagic prey, and used model simulations to investigate the mechanisms
   underpinning search strategies. Orientation of outbound headings in line
   with returning birds enables departing birds to avoid areas without prey
   even at relatively low population densities. The mechanisms underpinning
   local enhancement are more effective as population densities increase
   and may be facilitated by other mechanisms that concentrate individuals
   in profitable areas. For seabirds and other central place foragers
   foraging on unpredictable and ephemeral food resources, information is
   especially valuable when resources are spatially concentrated and may
   play an important role in mitigating poor foraging conditions.},

Title = {Diet composition and foraging habitats of Adelie and gentoo penguins in
   three different stages of their annual cycle},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {163},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We evaluated the diet of Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and gentoo (P.
   papua) penguins at Stranger Point colony (25 de Mayo/King George Island)
   during different stages of their annual cycle using the stable isotope
   method and the conventional dietary analyses (i. e. stomach contents).
   Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) dominated the diet of Adelie and
   gentoo penguins in all three studied stages (pre-breeding, breeding and
   post-breeding). Nevertheless, only in gentoo penguins a shift in the
   diet was evident from mainly krill during the breeding stage to mixed
   diet (i.e. krill and fish/squids) during the pre-and post-breeding
   stages. Results from stable isotopes suggest that Adelie penguins might
   be foraging in southern localities compared to their congener during the
   inter-breeding period. Moreover, Adelie penguins showed a large
   individual variability in foraging habitat during the post-breeding
   stage. However, our model has predicted that both species exploited
   similar areas during the breeding season. The results obtained during
   the chick-rearing stage were compared with the stomach contents of both
   species obtained during the same season (2011/2012). Our findings
   provide new knowledge on the feeding ecology and foraging habitats of
   pygoscelid penguins. They confirm the importance of Antarctic krill
   during the annual cycle and improve the understanding of life strategies
   and predator-prey interactions essentially out of the reproductive
   period, in which the information is very limited. These results can help
   to establish new management strategies, particularly considering the
   potential overlap between predators and fisheries.},

Title = {Towards population-level conservation in the critically endangered
   Antarctic blue whale: the number and distribution of their populations},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Population-level conservation is required to prevent biodiversity loss
   within a species, but it first necessitates determining the number and
   distribution of populations. Many whale populations are still depleted
   due to 20th century whaling. Whales are one of the most logistically
   difficult and expensive animals to study because of their mobility,
   pelagic lifestyle and often remote habitat. We tackle the question of
   population structure in the Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus
   intermedia) - a critically endangered subspecies and the largest extant
   animal - by capitalizing on the largest genetic dataset to date for
   Antarctic blue whales. We found evidence of three populations that are
   sympatric in the Antarctic feeding grounds and likely occupy separate
   breeding grounds. Our study adds to knowledge of population structure in
   the Antarctic blue whale. Future research should invest in locating the
   breeding grounds and migratory routes of Antarctic blue whales through
   satellite telemetry to confirm their population structure and allow
   population-level conservation.},

Abstract = {Laboratory and field studies on the age, growth, mortality, and
   recruitment dynamics of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; hereafter
   ``krill{''}) have greatly increased knowledge of its life history over
   the last 30 years. The development of long, standardized time series of
   recruitment and abundance have provided data to test and refine
   conceptual models of krill recruitment, and to examine the role of
   environmental factors and climatic variability on recruitment and cohort
   size. Laboratory studies have also greatly increased knowledge about
   intrinsic and extrinsic factors governing growth and moulting frequency
   that have been used to develop more robust models for krill growth.
   These findings have demonstrated the plasticity of krill life history
   and can provide the foundation for understanding krill population
   response to future climate change. However, the lack of progress on the
   development of conservative, direct measures of krill age continue to
   hamper the ability to properly compare and contrast growth and
   recruitment across environments.},

Booktitle = {BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC KRILL},
Series = {Advances in Polar Ecology},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {21-100},
Abstract = {There are increasing concerns over potential long-term changes in krill
   distribution and abundance, determining whether such changes are related
   to climate change and/or harvesting and how they might be distinguished
   from multi-scale variability. With nearly a century of observations on
   krill distribution, the general patterns of occurrence were determined
   over 50 years ago, however the last decade has seen an important
   consolidation of details of seasonal and inter-annual distributions,
   although some potentially important krill habitats such as the
   Bellingshausen, Amundsen and Ross Seas are still poorly sampled.
   Moreover the unexplored perennial multi-year pack-ice regions still
   await survey by remote under-ice samplers. Krill consistently occur in
   the upper 200 m of the ocean but various recent observations show that a
   substantial proportion of the population may be found below this pelagic
   zone. To further understand variability and change there has been a
   focus on the importance of historic data with the compilation of
   comprehensive databases, re-analysis of large scale synoptic surveys and
   the generation of smaller scale time series that now span several
   decades. In particular the compilation of 90 years of net samples has
   provided a key resource both in showing changes in large-scale abundance
   over the last 50 years and together with acoustic data in generating
   modern estimates of overall krill abundance and biomass. Meanwhile, the
   increasing availability of ocean circulation models together with
   remotely sensed data, has enabled the exploration of large-scale
   teleconnections at both the regional (Scotia Sea) and circum-polar scale
   and at the seasonal to decadal time scales.},

Title = {Temperature-dependent growth of Thysanoessa macrura: inter-annual and
   spatial variability around Elephant Island, Antarctica},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {529},
Pages = {49-61},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Somatic growth of pelagic invertebrates is controlled by temperature and
   food, both of which vary in space and time. Species-specific growth rate
   responses to environmental variability may affect populations through
   changes in reproductive potential; therefore, measuring spatial and
   temporal variability in growth rates of highly abundant zooplankton is
   critical to predict the impact of climate change on pelagic ecosystems.
   Here, we used length frequencies from bi-annual surveys conducted 1
   month apart to estimate growth rates of one the most abundant
   euphausiids in the Southern Ocean, Thysanoessa macrura. We analyzed
   summer data from 4 separate years (1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004) that
   varied widely in temperature and primary production. Stations within the
   surveys were grouped by water characteristics: warm, low salinity
   Antarctic Circum polar Current (ACC) water, and cold, saline Bransfield
   Strait and Weddell Sea (MBW) water, to assess inter-annual and spatial
   variability in cohort growth. Mid-summer cohort growth rates of T.
   macrura varied between years and water masses, ranging from -0.037 mm
   d(-1) in MBW water in 2004 to 0.081 mm d(-1) in ACC water in 1995.
   Growth rates were faster in ACC water than in MBW water during all
   years. Growth rates were strongly correlated with temperature (R-2 =
   0.82) but weakly correlated with copepod density (R-2 = 0.38), and were
   not correlated with chl a concentration (R-2 = 0.11). These results
   suggest that the growth rates of T. macrura may increase in regions
   exhibiting warming trends, such as the Antarctic Peninsula. This
   contrasts with published data on the growth rates of Euphausia superba,
   which is predicted to be impacted negatively by climate warming.},

Title = {Spatial assessment of fin whale hotspots and their association with

Volume = {161},

Abstract = {Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) habitat use and its relationship
   to environmental conditions are generally unknown in the Southern Ocean,
   presenting challenges for predicting their seasonal occurrence and
   potential effects of fishing pressure and climate change on this
   endangered species. Using biological data collected during 14 shipboard
   surveys off the northern Antarctic Peninsula and oceanographic data from
   satellite remote sensing, we mapped the distribution of fin whale
   hotspots, Antarctic krill abundance (biomass from acoustics,
   concentrations from nets) and ocean conditions during mid- and
   late-summer to investigate the environmental determinants of whale
   hotspots. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to test the
   hypothesis that intra-seasonal changes in fin whale hotspot distribution
   relate to sea surface temperature (SST), krill abundance and eddy
   kinetic energy (EKE). More whale hotspots (sightings and individuals)
   are observed during late- than mid-summer surveys. During mid-summer,
   hotspots occurred near Elephant Island while in late-summer they were
   distributed throughout the slope region in proximity to the mean
   location of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The
   spatial mean of EKE did not differ between mid- and late-summer surveys,
   but the spatial mean of SST was significantly warmer during late-summer.
   The GAM for mid-summer indicates that fin whale hotspots were positively
   related to SST, EKE and acoustically determined krill biomass. The GAM
   for late-summer indicates the hotspots were negatively related to
   net-based krill abundance and positively related to acoustic krill
   biomass and EKE. This study is important because environmental
   determinants of fin whale hotspots may be used as reference points for
   implementing future conservation plans for their recovering populations.},

Title = {Winter and spring controls on the summer food web of the coastal West
   Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which climate variability affects
   multiple trophic levels in food webs is essential for determining
   ecosystem responses to climate change. Here we use over two decades of
   data collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program
   (PAL-LTER) to determine how large-scale climate and local physical
   forcing affect phytoplankton, zooplankton and an apex predator along the
   West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We show that positive anomalies in
   chlorophyll-a (chl-a) at Palmer Station, occurring every 4-6 years, are
   constrained by physical processes in the preceding winter/spring and a
   negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Favorable conditions
   for phytoplankton included increased winter ice extent and duration,
   reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water column stability via
   enhanced salinity-driven density gradients. Years of positive chl-a
   anomalies are associated with the initiation of a robust krill cohort
   the following summer, which is evident in Adelie penguin diets, thus
   demonstrating tight trophic coupling. Projected climate change in this
   region may have a significant, negative impact on phytoplankton biomass,
   krill recruitment and upper trophic level predators in this coastal
   Antarctic ecosystem.},

Title = {The Response of Antarctic Sea Ice Algae to Changes in pH and CO2},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 28},
Abstract = {Ocean acidification substantially alters ocean carbon chemistry and
   hence pH but the effects on sea ice formation and the CO2 concentration
   in the enclosed brine channels are unknown. Microbial communities
   inhabiting sea ice ecosystems currently contribute 10-50\% of the annual
   primary production of polar seas, supporting overwintering zooplankton
   species, especially Antarctic krill, and seeding spring phytoplankton
   blooms. Ocean acidification is occurring in all surface waters but the
   strongest effects will be experienced in polar ecosystems with
   significant effects on all trophic levels. Brine algae collected from
   McMurdo Sound (Antarctica) sea ice was incubated in situ under various
   carbonate chemistry conditions. The carbon chemistry was manipulated
   with acid, bicarbonate and bases to produce a pCO(2) and pH range from
   238 to 6066 mu atm and 7.19 to 8.66, respectively. Elevated pCO(2)
   positively affected the growth rate of the brine algal community,
   dominated by the unique ice dinoflagellate, Polarella glacialis. Growth
   rates were significantly reduced when pH dropped below 7.6. However,
   when the pH was held constant and the pCO(2) increased, growth rates of
   the brine algae increased by more than 20\% and showed no decline at
   pCO(2) values more than five times current ambient levels. We suggest
   that projected increases in seawater pCO(2), associated with OA, will
   not adversely impact brine algal communities.},

Title = {Advances in Marine Ecosystem Dynamics from US GLOBEC The
   Horizontal-Advection Bottom-up Forcing Paradigm},
Journal = {OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {A primary focus of the US Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC)
   program was to identify the mechanisms of ecosystem response to
   large-scale climate forcing under the assumption that bottom-up forcing
   controls a large fraction of marine ecosystem variability. At the
   beginning of GLOBEC, the prevailing bottom-up forcing hypothesis was
   that climate-induced changes in vertical transport modulated nutrient
   supply and surface primary productivity, which in turn affected the
   lower trophic levels (e.g., zooplankton) and higher trophic levels
   (e.g., fish) through the trophic cascade. Although upwelling dynamics
   were confirmed to be an important driver of ecosystem variability in
   GLOBEC studies, the use of eddy-resolving regional-scale ocean
   circulation models combined with field observations revealed that
   horizontal advection is an equally important driver of marine ecosystem
   variability. Through a synthesis of studies from the four US GLOBEC
   regions (Gulf of Alaska, Northern California Current, Northwest
   Atlantic, and Southern Ocean), a new horizontal-advection bottom-up
   forcing paradigm emerges in which large-scale climate forcing drives
   regional changes in alongshore and cross-shelf ocean transport that
   directly impact ecosystem functions (e.g., productivity, species
   composition, spatial connectivity). The horizontal advection bottom-up
   forcing paradigm expands the mechanistic pathways through which climate
   variability and climate change impact the marine ecosystem. In
   particular, these results highlight the need for future studies to
   resolve and understand the role of mesoscale and submesoscale transport
   processes and their relationship to climate.},

Title = {Modeling environmental controls on the transport and fate of early life
   stages of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) on the western Antarctic
   Peninsula continental shelf},
Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {17-31},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A one-dimensional, temperature-dependent model was used to simulate the
   descent ascent cycle of the embryos and early larval stages of Antarctic
   krill to determine which regions of the western Antarctic Peninsula
   (wAP) continental shelf support successful completion of this cycle
   under present environmental conditions and those projected to occur as a
   result of climate change. The transport and fate of the embryo and larva
   under present and modified conditions was investigated with Lagrangian
   particle tracking simulations. The two modeling studies were implemented
   using temperature and density (embryo larva model) and circulation
   distributions (Lagrangian particle tracking) obtained from a high
   resolution version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for
   the wAP shelf region. Additional simulations used temperature and
   circulation distributions obtained from simulations that were forced
   with increased wind speed and increased transport of the Antarctic
   Circumpolar Current (ACC), both projected to possibly occur with climate
   change in the wAP region. Simulations using present conditions showed
   that successful completion of the descent ascent cycle occurred along
   the outer shelf and on the shelf in regions with bottom depths of
   600-700 m. Estimated residence times for the shelf regions that support
   success of the embryo and larva were 20-30 days. Thus, krill spawned in
   the mid and inner shelf regions can be retained in these regions through
   development to the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1). Increased winds
   and ACC transport resulted in more onshelf transport of Circumpolar Deep
   Water (CDW), which increased the volume of warm (1-1.5 degrees C) water
   at depth. These conditions supported a moderate increase in success of
   the krill embryo and larva, but only for limited areas of the shelf
   where hatching depths decreased by 10-30 m (<5\%) and development time
   to the calyptopis 1 stage decreased by 15-20\%. The modified circulation
   conditions also supported increased advection of krill larvae into areas
   of the shelf that would experience the largest reduction of sea ice,
   especially in winter. Projected changes in wind strength and COW
   transport may potentially enhance larval survival and advection onto the
   wAP shelf, but recruitment may be decreased by modifications to local
   sea ice distributions that would impede survival of Antarctic krill that
   overwinter on the shelf. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Risk maps for Antarctic krill under projected Southern Ocean
   acidification},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Marine ecosystems of the Southern Ocean are particularly vulnerable to
   ocean acidification(1). Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; hereafter
   krill) is the key pelagic species of the region and its largest fishery
   resource(2). There is therefore concern about the combined effects of
   climate change, ocean acidification and an expanding fishery on krill
   and ultimately, their dependent predators-whales, seals and
   penguins(3,4). However, little is known about the sensitivity of krill
   to ocean acidification. Juvenile and adult krill are already exposed to
   variable seawater carbonate chemistry because they occupy a range of
   habitats and migrate both vertically and horizontally on a daily and
   seasonal basis(5). Moreover, krill eggs sink from the surface to hatch
   at 700-1,000m (ref. 6), where the carbon dioxide partial pressure
   (p(CO2)) in sea water is already greater than it is in the
   atmosphere(7). Krill eggs sink passively and so cannot avoid these
   conditions. Here we describe the sensitivity of krill egg hatch rates to
   increased CO2, and present a circumpolar risk map of krill hatching
   success under projected p(CO2) levels. We find that important krill
   habitats of the Weddell Sea and the Haakon VII Sea to the east are
   likely to become high-risk areas for krill recruitment within a century.
   Furthermore, unless CO2 emissions are mitigated, the Southern Ocean
   krill population could collapse by 2300 with dire consequences for the
   entire ecosystem.},

Title = {Potential Climate Change Effects on the Habitat of Antarctic Krill in
   the Weddell Quadrant of the Southern Ocean},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Antarctic krill is a cold water species, an increasingly important
   fishery resource and a major prey item for many fish, birds and mammals
   in the Southern Ocean. The fishery and the summer foraging sites of many
   of these predators are concentrated between 0 degrees and 90 degrees W.
   Parts of this quadrant have experienced recent localised sea surface
   warming of up to 0.2 degrees C per decade, and projections suggest that
   further widespread warming of 0.27 degrees to 1.08 degrees C will occur
   by the late 21st century. We assessed the potential influence of this
   projected warming on Antarctic krill habitat with a statistical model
   that links growth to temperature and chlorophyll concentration. The
   results divide the quadrant into two zones: a band around the Antarctic
   Circumpolar Current in which habitat quality is particularly vulnerable
   to warming, and a southern area which is relatively insensitive. Our
   analysis suggests that the direct effects of warming could reduce the
   area of growth habitat by up to 20\%. The reduction in growth habitat
   within the range of predators, such as Antarctic fur seals, that forage
   from breeding sites on South Georgia could be up to 55\%, and the
   habitat's ability to support Antarctic krill biomass production within
   this range could be reduced by up to 68\%. Sensitivity analysis suggests
   that the effects of a 50\% change in summer chlorophyll concentration
   could be more significant than the direct effects of warming. A
   reduction in primary production could lead to further habitat
   degradation but, even if chlorophyll increased by 50\%, projected
   warming would still cause some degradation of the habitat accessible to
   predators. While there is considerable uncertainty in these projections,
   they suggest that future climate change could have a significant
   negative effect on Antarctic krill growth habitat and, consequently, on
   Southern Ocean biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Title = {Dynamic intra-seasonal habitat use by Antarctic fur seals suggests

Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {160},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1383-1393},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) are major secondary
   consumers in the Southern Ocean, placing them in potential competition
   with commercial fisheries and requiring research to understand their
   seasonal habitat use. Using the data obtained during 14 shipboard
   surveys sampled on a fixed grid (150 K km(2)) during mid- to late
   summer, I quantified the spatial distribution and intra-seasonal
   variability of fur seal sightings relative to distance to land and
   hydrographic boundaries. I test the hypothesis that fur seals display an
   increase in their at-sea abundance during mid- to late summer near the
   Antarctic Peninsula as they prepare to take up wintering grounds. I also
   test whether abundances of their potential prey, krill and myctophids,
   exhibit intra-seasonal variability. During midsummer, high-abundance
   areas are located near major breeding colonies; however, during late
   summer, there is an order-of-magnitude increase in fur seal abundance,
   coinciding with an increase in the number of high-abundance areas
   located in Bransfield Strait. Coincidently, abundance of Euphausia
   superba decreased and the myctophid Electrona antarctica increased
   between mid- and late-summer surveys. High-abundance areas of fur seals
   are not associated with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front
   but are concentrated within 100 km from land, potentially indicating the
   location of haul out and important coastal habitat use areas. The
   dynamic increase in the number and location of high-abundance areas
   during late summer represents a considerable amount of mammalian
   predators entering the Antarctic Peninsula marine ecosystem. This
   information is important for understanding the seasonal impact of fur
   seals on regional marine food webs and their potential interaction with
   the autumn-winter krill fishery.},

Volume = {32},
Abstract = {Seabird abundances and breeding distribution have the potential to serve
   as ecological indicators. The western Antarctic Peninsula is one of the
   three sites in the world with the greatest increases in local
   temperature during the last 50 years. The aim of this study was to
   monitor the distribution and abundance of breeding populations of
   seabirds in the northern sector of the Danco Coast, north-west of the
   Antarctic Peninsula, during the breeding season 2010/11. The birds were
   the Wilson's storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), South Polar skua
   (Stercorarius maccormicki), kelp gull (Larus dominicanus), Antarctic
   tern (Sterna vittata), snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), chinstrap
   penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), southern giant petrel (Macronectes
   giganteus), gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Cape petrel (Daption
   capense) and Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis). Annual
   breeding population growth increased in pygoscelids, southern giant
   petrel and sheathbill, and for the remaining species, breeding
   population trends were stable. Given that seabird populations can
   provide valuable information on the conditions of their feeding and
   nesting environments, this study highlights the need to maintain basics

Title = {Increased Feeding and Nutrient Excretion of Adult Antarctic Krill,
   Euphausia superba, Exposed to Enhanced Carbon Dioxide (CO2)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Ocean acidification has a wide-ranging potential for impacting the
   physiology and metabolism of zooplankton. Sufficiently elevated CO2
   concentrations can alter internal acid-base balance, compromising
   homeostatic regulation and disrupting internal systems ranging from
   oxygen transport to ion balance. We assessed feeding and nutrient
   excretion rates in natural populations of the keystone species Euphausia
   superba (Antarctic krill) by conducting a CO2 perturbation experiment at
   ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 levels in January 2011 along the
   West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Under elevated CO2 conditions (similar
   to 672 ppm), ingestion rates of krill averaged 78 mu g C individual(-1)
   d(-1) and were 3.5 times higher than krill ingestion rates at ambient,
   present day CO2 concentrations. Additionally, rates of ammonium,
   phosphate, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) excretion by krill were
   1.5, 1.5, and 3.0 times higher, respectively, in the high CO2 treatment
   than at ambient CO2 concentrations. Excretion of urea, however, was
   similar to 17\% lower in the high CO2 treatment, suggesting differences
   in catabolic processes of krill between treatments. Activities of key
   metabolic enzymes, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and lactate dehydrogenase
   (LDH), were consistently higher in the high CO2 treatment. The observed
   shifts in metabolism are consistent with increased physiological costs
   associated with regulating internal acid-base equilibria. This
   represents an additional stress that may hamper growth and reproduction,
   which would negatively impact an already declining krill population
   along the WAP.},

Title = {THE ROSS SEA IN A SEA OF CHANGE},
Journal = {OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {90-103},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Ross Sea, the most productive region in the Antarctic, reaches
   farther south than any body of water in the world. While its food web is
   relatively intact, its oceanography, biogeochemistry, and sea ice
   coverage have been changing dramatically, and likely will continue to do
   so in the future. Sea ice cover and persistence have been increasing, in
   contrast to the Amundsen-Bellingshausen sector, which has resulted in
   reduced open water duration for its biota. Models predict that as the
   ozone hole recovers, ice cover will begin to diminish. Currents on the
   continental shelf will likely change in the coming century, with a
   projected intensification of flow leading to altered deep ocean
   ventilation. Such changes in ice and circulation will lead to altered
   plankton distributions and composition, but it is difficult at present
   to predict the nature of these changes. Iron and irradiance play central
   roles in regulating phytoplankton production in the Ross Sea, but the
   impacts of oceanographic changes on the biogeochemistry of iron are
   unclear. Unlike other Southern Ocean regions, where continental shelves
   are very narrow and Antarctic krill dominates the herbivorous fauna, the
   broad shelf of the Ross Sea is dominated by crystal krill and
   silverfish, which are the major prey items for higher trophic levels. At
   present, the Ross Sea is considered to be one of the most species-rich
   areas of the Southern Ocean and a biodiversity ``hotspot{''} due to its
   heterogeneous habitats. Despite being among the best-studied regions in
   the entire Southern Ocean, accurate predictions of the impacts of
   climate change on the oceanography and ecology of the Ross Sea remain
   fraught with uncertainty.},

Title = {Effects of climate change on an emperor penguin population: analysis of

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {18},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sea ice conditions in the Antarctic affect the life cycle of the emperor
   penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). We present a population projection for
   the emperor penguin population of Terre Adelie, Antarctica, by linking
   demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex
   matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of IPCC
   climate models. Based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture
   analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (SICa)
   affect adult survival and breeding success. Demographic models show that
   both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized
   at intermediate values of annual SICa, because neither the complete
   absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide
   satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. We show that under some
   conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the
   variance in SICa. We identify an ensemble of five general circulation
   climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea
   ice concentration in Terre Adelie. The output of this ensemble is used
   to produce stochastic forecasts of SICa, which in turn drive the
   population model. Uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple
   climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes
   parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error.
   The median of these simulations predicts a decline of the Terre Adelie
   emperor penguin population of 81\% by the year 2100. We find a 43\%
   chance of an even greater decline, of 90\% or more. The uncertainty in
   population projections reflects large differences among climate models
   in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. One such model predicts
   population increases over much of the century, but overall, the ensemble
   of models predicts that population declines are far more likely than
   population increases. We conclude that climate change is a significant
   risk for the emperor penguin. Our analytical approach, in which
   demographic models are linked to IPCC climate models, is powerful and
   generally applicable to other species and systems.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we lay out the theoretical framework for using modeling
   approaches from behavioral ecology (in particular, state-dependent and
   game theoretical models) to predict the behavioral responses of central
   place foragers to changes in their food environment. We develop
   individual-based models of the state-dependent behavior of individual
   central place foragers over the course of a breeding season and show how
   our approach provides a framework for the prediction of trip lengths,
   foraging location, food delivery, and reproductive success. We formulate
   a common framework of models for northern fur seals (Callorhinus
   ursinus), black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), and thick-billed
   murres (Uria lomvia), and provide worked examples parameterized to
   represent fur seals and murres. We then develop a game theoretic model
   at the colony-level for predicting the distribution of multiple
   individuals across space in the face of potential interference or
   facilitation, providing a worked example for kittiwakes. We demonstrate
   how these models can be used to predict near-term aspects of foraging
   behavior such as diet choice and trip destinations and durations at the
   individual and colony level. We show how (i) behavioral predictions can
   be translated into predictions of foraging success, (ii) foraging
   success can be scaled up to demographically relevant parameters such as
   survival and reproduction, and (iii) this approach can help predict
   impacts of environmental change on top-level predators. (C) 2012

Volume = {24},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Wide-ranging, surface-feeding pelagic seabirds are the most numerous
   functional group of birds in the Southern Ocean. The mesoscale habitat
   use of these birds is increasingly being quantified by relating their
   movements to remotely sensed, near surface properties of the ocean.
   However, prey availability at the sea surface may also be determined by
   habitat characteristics not measurable from space. For instance,
   benthic-pelagic coupling, which occurs when seabed processes affect
   productivity in the epipelagic zone, can link benthic habitat type to
   availability of surface prey. We combined acoustically derived maps of
   the substrate of the South Georgia shelf with GPS tracking to quantify
   the sub-mesoscale habitat use of breeding black-browed albatrosses. We
   show that albatrosses preferentially used waters overlaying glacial
   moraine banks near the shelf edge and that this was unrelated to the
   presence of trawlers targeting mackerel icefish, which are also
   associated with these features. Stomach temperature profiles suggest
   that albatrosses primarily caught krill and fish over the banks. We
   hypothesize that black-browed albatrosses target waters overlaying
   moraine banks due to upward benthic-pelagic coupling, mediated by an
   increase in abundance of zooplankton such as Antarctic krill. Our
   findings suggest that the potential effects of such processes on pelagic
   seabird distribution warrant wider investigation.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {A new perspective on the role of lipids in zooplankton is proposed, with
   solidliquid phase transitions of lipids being a factor regulating their
   buoyancy. These phase transitions are controlled by zooplankton in
   relation to their physical environment, through the selective
   accumulation of specific lipids with optimum levels of unsaturation. The
   necessity to control buoyancy and maintain an optimum depth is a
   fundamental evolutionary force, driving anatomical, biochemical and
   behavioural adaptations of all organisms within the aquatic realm. It is
   hypothesized that each species adjusts the amount, composition and
   anatomical location of lipids, to maximize fitness according to their
   preferred habitat and life history traits. Recent discoveries regarding
   the role of phase transitions of lipids in marine zooplankton and their
   role in regulating buoyancy will require re-interpretation of existing
   data and stimulate future scientific endeavours in zooplankton research.},

Abstract = {Concern has been voiced in recent years regarding the environmental
   implications of the Antarctic krill fishery. Attention has focused
   primarily on ecological concerns, whereas other environmental aspects,
   including potentially globally problematic emissions and material and
   energy demands, have not been examined in detail. Here we apply life
   cycle assessment to measure the contributions of krill meal, oil, and
   omega-3 capsules to global warming, ozone depletion, acidification,
   eutrophication, energy use, and biotic resource use. Supply chains of
   one krill fishing and processing company, Aker BioMarine of Norway, were
   assessed. Impacts of krill products were found to be driven primarily by
   the combustion of fossil fuels onboard the fishing vessel and a
   transport/resupply vessel. Approximately 190 L of fuel are burned per
   tonne of raw krill landed, markedly higher than fuel inputs to reduction
   fisheries targeting other species. In contrast, the biotic resource use
   associated with extracting krill is relatively low compared to that of
   other reduction fisheries. Results of this study provide insight into
   the broader environmental implications of the krill fishery, comparisons
   between products derived from krill and other species targeted for
   reduction, opportunities for improving the fishery's performance, and a
   baseline against which to measure future performance.},

Title = {Responses of Antarctic pack-ice seals to environmental change and
   increasing krill fishing},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {149},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-50},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The compound effects of changing habitats, ecosystem interactions, and
   fishing practices have implications for the management of Antarctic
   krill and conservation of its predators. For Antarctic pack-ice seals,
   an important group of krill predators, we estimate the density and krill
   consumption in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP)-Western Weddell Sea
   area, the main fishery region; and we consider long-term changes in
   suitable pack-ice habitat, increased fishing pressure and potential
   krill declines based upon predictions from declines in sea ice cover.
   More than 3 million crabeater seals consumed over 12 million tonnes of
   krill each year. This was approximately 17\% of the krill standing
   stock. The highest densities of pack ice seals where found in the WAP,
   including in its small-scale fishery management areas, where apparently
   suitable seal habitat has declined by 21-28\% over a 30 year period,
   where krill density is likely to have declined, and fishing has
   increased. The highest seal density was found in the Marguerite Bay area
   which is a source of krill for the Antarctic Peninsula and elsewhere.
   Significant sea-ice loss since 1979 has already occurred, leading to
   open water and possible expansion for the fishery in the future. These
   factors may combine to potentially reduce food for pack ice seals.
   Therefore, high uncertainty in krill and seal stock trends and in their
   environmental drivers call for a precautionary management of the krill
   fishery, in the absence of survey data to support management based on
   specific conservation objectives for pack-ice seals. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Behaviour and life-history strategies of zooplankton have evolved in
   response to seasonal cycles in food availability, predation risk and
   abiotic conditions. A key challenge is to understand how different
   activities over the year are linked. For instance, how does a change in
   spring activities, such as the timing or amount of egg production,
   influence autumn activities, for instance energy storage or migration?
   Trade-offs viewed in relation to individual lifetime fitness
   consequences couple these events. The framework of optimal annual
   routines provides theory and methodology for consistent analyses of
   these temporal trade-offs. Here I describe the key parts of optimal
   annual routine models and how the models can be used to: (i) study
   phenology, life-history strategies, and population dynamics; (ii)
   predict responses to environmental change; and (iii) guide future
   zooplankton studies. I mainly discuss the adaptations of zooplankton
   species inhabiting high latitude oceans where the seasonal cycle and its
   effects are particularly strong. Empirical challenges include issues of
   seasonal resolution, state-dependent processes and individual
   variability. Two ecological problems with avenues for future work are
   discussed in particular detail: the role of sea ice and ice algae in the
   life cycle of copepods and krill, and the adaptive value and ecological
   consequences of semelparous versus iteroparous reproductive strategies.},

Abstract = {The role of intracontinental migration patterns of European eel
   (Anguilla anguilla) receives more and more recognition in both
   ecological studies of the European eel and possible management measures,
   but small-scale patterns proved to be challenging to study. We
   experimentally investigated the suitability of fatty acid trophic
   markers to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats. Eight groups
   of juvenile European eels were fed on eight different diets in a
   freshwater recirculation system at 20A degrees C for 56 days. Three
   groups were fed on freshwater diets (Rutilus rutilus, Chironomidae
   larvae, and Gammarus pulex) and four groups were reared on diets of a
   marine origin (Clupea harengus, Crangon crangon, Mysis spec., and
   Euphausia superba) and one on commercial pellets used in eel
   aquaculture. Fatty acid composition (FAC) of diets differed
   significantly with habitat. FAC of eel muscle tissue seemed to be rather
   insensitive to fatty acids supplied with diet, but the general pattern
   of lower n3:n6 and EPA:ARA ratios in freshwater prey organisms could be
   traced in the respective eels. Multivariate statistics of the fatty acid
   composition of the eels resulted in two distinct groups representing
   freshwater and marine treatments. Results further indicate the
   capability of selectively restraining certain fatty acids in eel, as
   e.g. the n3:n6 ratio in all treatments was < 4, regardless of dietary
   n3:n6. In future studies on wild eel, these measures can be used to
   elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats of individual European
   eel.},

Title = {The Association of Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba with the Under-Ice
   Habitat},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {The association of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba with the under-ice
   habitat was investigated in the Lazarev Sea (Southern Ocean) during
   austral summer, autumn and winter. Data were obtained using novel
   Surface and Under Ice Trawls (SUIT), which sampled the 0-2 m surface
   layer both under sea ice and in open water. Average surface layer
   densities ranged between 0.8 individuals m(-2) in summer and autumn, and
   2.7 individuals m(-2) in winter. In summer, under-ice densities of
   Antarctic krill were significantly higher than in open waters. In
   autumn, the opposite pattern was observed. Under winter sea ice,
   densities were often low, but repeatedly far exceeded summer and autumn
   maxima. Statistical models showed that during summer high densities of
   Antarctic krill in the 0-2 m layer were associated with high ice
   coverage and shallow mixed layer depths, among other factors. In autumn
   and winter, density was related to hydrographical parameters. Average
   under-ice densities from the 0-2 m layer were higher than corresponding
   values from the 0-200 m layer collected with Rectangular Midwater Trawls
   (RMT) in summer. In winter, under-ice densities far surpassed maximum
   0-200 m densities on several occasions. This indicates that the
   importance of the ice-water interface layer may be under-estimated by
   the pelagic nets and sonars commonly used to estimate the population
   size of Antarctic krill for management purposes, due to their limited
   ability to sample this habitat. Our results provide evidence for an
   almost year-round association of Antarctic krill with the under-ice
   habitat, hundreds of kilometres into the ice-covered area of the Lazarev
   Sea. Local concentrations of postlarval Antarctic krill under winter sea
   ice suggest that sea ice biota are important for their winter survival.
   These findings emphasise the susceptibility of an ecological key species
   to changing sea ice habitats, suggesting potential ramifications on
   Antarctic ecosystems induced by climate change.},

   detected by diel (i.e., 24-hour based) or seasonal periodical trawling
   as a consequence of massive inward and outward displacements of
   populations to and from the sample areas. As a result, significant
   errors in population/stock and biodiversity assessments performed by
   trawling may occur if timing of sampling is not taken into account. The
   increasing number of cabled and permanent multiparametric seafloor
   observatories now allows direct, continuous, and long-lasting monitoring
   of benthic ecosystems and analysis in relation to several habitat
   cycles. This review describes the adaptation of this technology to
   investigations of rhythmic behaviour by focussing on automated video
   imaging. Did l fluctuations in the number of video-observed individuals
   can be used as a measure of average population rhythmic behaviour. The
   potential implementation of automated video image analysis in relation
   to animal tracking and classification procedures based on the combined
   use of morphometric tools and multivariate statistics is detailed in
   relation to populational and community studies. Based on video cameras
   mounted at multiparametric cabled observatories, an integrated
   time-series analysis protocol using chronobiomedical procedures is
   proposed to place video-recorded bioinformation in an oceanographic
   context.},

Title = {A foodweb model to explore uncertainties in the South Georgia shelf

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Foodweb models provide a useful framework for compiling data on biomass,
   production, consumption and feeding relationships. They are particularly
   useful for identifying gaps and inconsistencies in the data, and for
   exploring plausible scenarios of change. We compiled data on the pelagic
   foodweb of the South Georgia shelf, which is one of the most intensively
   studied areas in the Southern Ocean. The data suggest that current
   average annual copepod production is three times that of Antarctic krill
   and that flying seabirds and fish are, respectively, responsible for
   25\% and 21\% of local krill consumption. The most striking
   inconsistency was that estimated consumption of fish was 5 times their
   estimated production. We developed a static mass balance model of the
   foodweb representing one of many possible solutions to the
   inconsistencies in the data. The model included sufficient fish biomass
   to balance the original consumption estimate, and consequently fish
   became the main krill consumers. Nonetheless, only 74\% of local krill
   production was consumed by predators, suggesting that there are
   additional mortality sources that we did not explicitly model. We
   developed further models to explore scenarios incorporating plausible
   climate-driven reductions in krill biomass. In scenarios with unchanged
   predator diets, an 80\% reduction in krill biomass resulted in a 73\%
   reduction in vertebrate biomass. However, when predators with diverse
   diets were able to switch to feeding on alternative zooplankton prey,
   total vertebrate biomass was maintained at current levels. Scenarios in
   which 80\% of krill biomass was replaced with copepod biomass required
   28\% more primary production because the estimated consumption rate of
   copepods is higher than that of krill. The additional copepod biomass
   did not alter the consequences for vertebrates. These scenarios
   illustrate the wide range of potential consequences of a shift from a
   krill to a copepod dominated system in a warming climate. They suggest
   that both maintenance and dramatic reduction of vertebrate production
   are plausible outcomes, although the former requires major changes in
   predator diets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Adding the ocean to the study of seabirds: a brief history of at-sea
   seabird research},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {451},
Pages = {231-243},
Abstract = {We review the history of how research directed towards marine
   ornithology has led to an appreciation of seabirds as highly specialized
   marine organisms. Beginning with R. C. Murphy (Pacific), V. C.
   Wynne-Edwards (Atlantic), and associates in the early 1900s, the
   research approach grew from an emphasis on seabird single-species
   ecology to an appreciation of interacting species assemblages and
   finally to seabirds being considered as important components of marine
   food webs. After a slow, drawn-out beginning, the initial main impetus
   for developing the field was a need to map seabird abundance and
   distribution tied to understanding impacts of continental shelf resource
   exploitation. Coalescing during the 1970s to 1980s to facilitate this
   line of research were 6 factors: (1) ability to identify birds at sea;
   (2) standardization of techniques to quantify abundance; (3) resources
   and techniques for mapping; (4) appreciation of how scale affects
   seabird relationships to hydrographic features and patchy prey; (5)
   development of computing power and appropriate statistics; and (6)
   seabird biologists becoming embedded in, as well as organizing,
   multidisciplinary marine research projects. Future advances in
   understanding the role of seabirds in marine food webs will be made by
   seabird biologists participating in multidisciplinary projects using
   grid-like surveys relative to oceanographic features in combination with
   instrumentation that reveals the finer details of seabird foraging
   behaviors.},

Title = {Ecological niche modeling of sympatric krill predators around Marguerite
   Bay, Western Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {58},
Number = {13-16},
Pages = {1729-1740},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), carabeater seals (Lobodon
   carcinophagus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae), and minke whales
   (Balaenoptera bonaernsis) are found in the waters surrounding the
   Western Antarctic Peninsula. Each species relies primarily on Antarctic
   krill (Euphausia superba) and has physiological constraints and foraging
   behaviors that dictate their ecological niches. Understanding the degree
   of ecological overlap between sympatric krill predators is critical to
   understanding and predicting the impacts on climate-driven changes to
   the Antarctic marine ecosystem. To explore ecological relationships
   amongst sympatric krill predators, we developed ecological niche models
   using a maximum entropy modeling approach (Maxent) that allows the
   integration of data collected by a variety of means (e.g.
   satellite-based locations and visual observations). We created spatially
   explicit probability distributions for the four krill predators in fall
   2001 and 2002 in conjunction with a suite of environmental variables. We
   find areas within Marguerite Bay with high krill predator occurrence
   rates or biological hot spots. We find the modeled ecological niches for
   Adelie penguins and crabeater seals may be affected by their
   physiological needs to haul-out on substrate. Thus, their distributions
   may be less dictated by proximity to prey and more so by physical
   features that over time provide adequate access to prey. Humpback and
   minke whales, being fully marine and having greater energetic demands,
   occupy ecological niches more directly proximate to prey. We also find
   evidence to suggest that the amount of overlap between modeled niches is
   relatively low, even for species with similar energetic requirements. In
   a rapidly changing and variable environment, our modeling work shows
   little indication that krill predators maintain similar ecological
   niches across years around Marguerite Bay. Given the amount of
   variability in the marine environment around the Antarctic Peninsula and
   how this affects the local abundance of prey, there may be consequences
   for krill predators with historically little niche overlap to increase
   the potential for interspecific competition for shared prey resources.

Title = {Seabird aggregation around free-drifting icebergs in the northwest

Abstract = {Seabird abundances and distributions can be influenced by seasonal
   variations in surface productivity, winds, and other environmental
   factors. Recently evidence emerged that free-drifting icebergs were
   hotspots of biogeochemical and ecological activity. They also represent
   physical habitat structure both above and below the sea surface. Here we
   found seabird abundances that were 2 to 6 times greater within about
   one-half km of free drifting icebergs than the area between about
   one-half and one km from the iceberg edge. Aggregation was measured by
   surveys with an experimental design for determining potential local
   impacts of free-drifting icebergs on seabird density. Seabird surveys
   were conducted during three cruises in the Weddell Sea from 4 to 20
   December 2005, 11 to 25 June 2008, and 21 March to 2 April 2009. Visual
   surveys were done on the vessel bridge typically for periods of five
   minutes facing the port or starboard side. Differences in species
   composition were also linked to distance from the iceberg edge for the
   most sampled icebergs with Daption capense exhibiting change in relative
   abundance. On a local scale, environmental factors such as surface
   productivity, air temperature, and winds were not consistently related
   to seabird distributions and community dynamics. The results suggest
   that climatically-driven variations in iceberg abundance would influence
   local seabird distributions with unknown impacts on regional abundances
   and species composition. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier

Title = {Gone with the currents: lack of genetic differentiation at the
   circum-continental scale in the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba},
Journal = {BMC GENETICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Background: Southern Ocean fauna represent a significant amount of
   global biodiversity, whose origin may be linked to glacial cycles
   determining local extinction/eradication with ice advance, survival of
   refugee populations and post-glacial re-colonization. This pattern
   implies high potential for differentiation in benthic shelf species with
   limited dispersal, yet consequences for pelagic organisms are less
   clear. The present study investigates levels of genetic variation and
   population structure of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba using
   mitochondrial DNA and EST-linked microsatellite markers for an
   unprecedentedly comprehensive sampling of its populations over a
   circum-Antarctic range.
   Results: MtDNA (ND1) sequences and EST-linked microsatellite markers
   indicated no clear sign of genetic structure among populations over
   large geographic scales, despite considerable power to detect
   differences inferred from forward-time simulations. Based on ND1, few
   instances of genetic heterogeneity, not significant after correction for
   multiple tests, were detected between geographic or temporal samples.
   Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution based on mtDNA sequences
   revealed strong evidence of past population expansion. Significant
   positive values of the parameter g (a measure of population growth) were
   obtained from microsatellite markers using a coalescent-based
   genealogical method and suggested a recent start (60 000 - 40 000 years
   ago) for the expansion.
   Conclusions: The results provide evidence of lack of genetic
   heterogeneity of Antarctic krill at large geographic scales and
   unequivocal support for recent population expansion. Lack of genetic
   structuring likely reflects the tight link between krill and
   circum-Antarctic ocean currents and is consistent with the hypothesis
   that differentiation processes in Antarctic species are largely
   influenced by dispersal potential, whereas small-scale spatial and
   temporal differentiation might be due to local conditions leading to
   genetic patchiness. The signal of recent population growth suggests
   differential impact of glacial cycles on pelagic Antarctic species,
   which experienced population expansion during glaciations with increased
   available habitat, versus sedentary benthic shelf species. EST-linked
   microsatellites provide new perspectives to complement the results based
   on mtDNA and suggest that data-mining of EST libraries will be a useful
   approach to facilitate use of microsatellites for additional species.},

Abstract = {Studies of the interactions of demersal fishing gear with the benthic
   environment are needed in order to manage conservation of benthic
   habitats. There has been limited direct assessment of these interactions
   through deployment of cameras on commercial fishing gear especially on
   demersal longlines. A compact, autonomous deep-sea video system was
   designed and constructed by the Australian Antarctic Division (MD) for
   deployment on commercial fishing gear to observe interactions with
   benthos in the Southern Ocean finfish fisheries (targeting toothfish,
   Dissostichus spp). The Benthic Impacts Camera System (BICS) is capable
   of withstanding depths to 2500 m, has been successfully fitted to both
   longline and demersal trawl fishing gear, and is suitable for routine
   deployment by non-experts such as fisheries observers or crew. The
   system is entirely autonomous, robust, compact, easy to operate, and has
   minimal effect on the performance of the fishing gear it is attached to.
   To date, the system has successfully captured footage that demonstrates
   the interactions between demersal fishing gear and the benthos during
   routine commercial operations. It provides the first footage
   demonstrating the nature of the interaction between demersal longlines
   and benthic habitats in the Southern Ocean, as well as showing potential
   as a tool for rapidly assessing habitat types and presence of mobile
   biota such as krill (Euphausia superba). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {ANTARCTIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {387-398},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper we review evidence for, and anticipated consequences of,
   climate change in Antarctic marine communities, examining the potential
   impacts on invertebrates and vertebrates alike and exploring plausible
   outcomes for species, with examples principally from the Antarctic
   literature. We suggest that industries with the greatest potential to
   aggravate climate change impacts on marine communities are marine
   capture fisheries. In the Southern Ocean, harvesting is governed under
   the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
   (CCAMLR). CCAMLR espouses an ecological management framework and so has
   the capacity to mitigate harvesting impacts such that they do not worsen
   impacts from climate change. We discuss some of the implications of
   climate change and advocate that CCAMLR address certain key issues if it
   is to fulfil its international obligations. It will be essential for
   CCAMLR to determine relative risks (uncertainties), impacts and
   timescales, of various processes consequent on climate change. Such risk
   assessments should be feasible with current knowledge and should provide
   a focus for future work. We believe it will be important to prioritize
   issues that reduce impacts and uncertainties by the greatest degree, and
   propose that future plans should involve shared responsibility (e.g.
   with SCAR etc.) for each of the risks described.},

Title = {Seasonal variation in oceanographic habitat and behaviour of
   white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis from Kerguelen Island},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {416},
Pages = {267-U288},
Abstract = {Marine environments experience seasonal variation in physical and
   biological parameters, with consequent changes in predator
   distributions. During the breeding period, proximity to suitable feeding
   sites is essential for central place foragers, whereas during the
   non-breeding period their distribution is relatively unconstrained. We
   combined light-based geolocation and satellite tracking to investigate
   seasonal variation in foraging grounds and behaviour of white-chinned
   petrels from Kerguelen Island. Birds were associated with highly
   productive areas throughout the year. During breeding (summer), they
   performed long commuting trips from the colony to distant, productive
   Antarctic waters. Thereafter, birds migrated 5200 km westwards to the
   Benguela upwelling system off Namibia and South Africa to spend the
   winter. This seasonal shift of foraging grounds coincides with a change
   in activity patterns; much less time was spent in flight in winter than
   in summer. Individual variability in the locations of foraging zones and
   seasonal/daily activity patterns was low. Trip durations were shorter
   during chick-rearing than incubation, although birds often travelled as
   far or farther, tracking the gradual break up of pack ice. Habitat use
   models revealed an association with distance to sea-ice edge and
   chlorophyll a gradient during incubation, whereas sea surface
   temperature and chlorophyll a gradient best explained habitat use during
   chick rearing. White-chinned petrels are likely to overlap with other
   marine predators and fisheries throughout the year. Fishery bycatch
   constitutes the most significant direct threat to petrels at sea.
   Moreover, future climate-induced reductions in productivity could affect
   birds year-round.},

   ecosystem-based fisheries management},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {399},
Pages = {243-252},
Abstract = {The South Georgia region supports a large biomass of krill that is
   subject to high inter-annual variability. The apparent lack of a locally
   self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that
   understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population
   characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of
   krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys
   conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to
   2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period
   from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics
   model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in
   krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the
   summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there
   was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A
   model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the
   magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest
   correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a
   krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained
   adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear
   to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population.
   The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment,
   especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of
   krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate
   the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial
   harvesting and/or climate change.},

Abstract = {The movement and dietary history of individuals can be studied using
   stable isotope records in archival keratinous tissues. Here, we present
   a chronology of temporally fine-scale data on the trophic niche of
   otariid seals by measuring the isotopic signature of serially sampled
   whiskers. Whiskers of male Antarctic fur seals breeding at the Crozet
   Islands showed synchronous and regular oscillations in both their
   delta(13)C and delta(15)N values that are likely to represent their
   annual migrations over the long term (mean 4.8 years). At the population
   level, male Antarctic fur seals showed substantial variation in both
   delta(13)C and delta(15)N values, occupying nearly all the `isotopic
   space' created by the diversity of potential oceanic habitats (from high
   Antarctica to the subtropics) and prey (from Antarctic krill to
   sub-antarctic and subtropical mesopelagic fishes). At the individual
   level, whisker isotopic signatures depict a large diversity of foraging
   strategies. Some seals remained in either subantarctic or Antarctic
   waters, while the migratory cycle of most animals encompassed a wide
   latitudinal gradient where they fed on different prey. The isotopic
   signature of whiskers, therefore, revealed new multi-year foraging
   strategies of male Antarctic fur seals and is a powerful tool for
   investigating the ecological niche during cryptic stages of mammals'
   life.},

Abstract = {We investigate the influence of krill (principally Euphausia superba)
   patchiness on the foraging distributions of seabirds to understand how
   variation in krill influences patch dynamics between krill and birds. At
   sea-surveys were conducted near Elephant Island, Antarctica, for 3 yr
   (2004-2006) during the annual U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources
   (AMLR) program. Standardized strip-transect surveys were used to map
   seabirds, and a combination of acoustic and net surveys was used to map
   krill. We measured patch size of krill and seabirds and elucidated how
   krill patch dynamics influence foraging seabirds. The spatial
   association between krill and predators was influenced by the size and
   arrangement of krill patches. We found a negative relationship between
   abundance and patchiness of krill and predators, indicating that when
   krill is less abundant, its predators are less abundant and
   concentrated. We conclude that annual patch dynamics of krill strongly
   influences the local abundance and distribution of seabirds. Such
   information should be used to interpret potential interactions between
   seabirds and krill fisheries operating near Elephant Island.},

Title = {Rapid warming of the ocean around South Georgia, Southern Ocean, during
   the 20th century: Forcings, characteristics and implications for lower
   trophic levels},

Abstract = {The Southern Ocean is known to have warmed considerably during the
   second half of the 20th century but there are few locations with data
   before the 1950s. In addition, assessments of change in this region are
   hampered by the strong seasonal bias in sampling, with the vast majority
   of data collected during the austral summer. However, oceanographic
   measurements near South Georgia span most of the last century, and we
   here consider almost year-round data from this location over an 81-year
   period (1925-2006). We observe significant warming between the early and
   late 20th century, with differential warming between summer and winter
   months and an indication that late 20th century summer temperatures
   peaked similar to 6 days earlier. To quantify the long-term warming
   trend in this highly variable data, a mixed model utilising a Residual
   Maximum Likelihood (REML) method was used. Over the 81-year period, a
   mean increase of similar to 0.9 degrees C in January and similar to 2.3
   degrees C in August was evident in the top 100 m of the water column.
   Warming diminished below 100 m and approached 0 at 200 m. Thus the
   long-term warming around South Georgia is substantial-more so than
   documented previously for the circumpolar warming of the Southern Ocean.
   We examine potential causal effects of this trend, including local
   atmospheric and cryospheric change, the influence of upstream waters and
   the role of coupled modes of climate variability such as El
   Nino/Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). It is
   likely that all of these play a part in the observed temperature
   increase. However, the role of the SAM is strongly indicated, via its
   likely role in the circumpolar warming trend in the Southern Ocean, and
   also by the atypical response of the South Georgia region to changes in
   heat fluxes associated with the SAM. Furthermore. the combination of a
   regional decline in ice extent and strong upstream warming likely
   explains a significant part of the strong seasonal variation apparent in
   the warming trend. In addition, we consider the implications that
   long-term warming has for South Georgia's lower trophic levels. For
   Euphausia superba, at their northern limit, we find a significant
   negative relationship between summer South Georgia water temperatures
   and mean summer density of E superba across the southwest Atlantic
   sector of the Southern Ocean. Simple abundance and growth rate
   relationships with our long-term temperature data appear to show
   declining habitat suitability for E superba. In contrast, the warming
   trend is likely to favour other macro- and mesozooplankton species that
   occupy the more northerly parts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current,
   and it is likely to promote phytoplankton growth. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The geographic remoteness, the lack of remote sensing capabilities, and
   the lack of appropriate environmental sensors make the detection of
   seasonal trends or inter-annual variations in sea-ice microbial biomass
   or production processes within the pack ice of the Antarctic extremely
   rare. The evaluation of their inter-annual variability in the context of
   ice dynamics and trends in regional climate has not been possible.
   During the late winters of 2001 (July-August) and 2002
   (August-September) we assessed sea-ice dynamics, sea-ice
   characteristics, and biomass of sea-ice microbiota along the Western
   Antarctic Peninsula. These two winters were marked by large contrasts in
   the dates of initial ice formation (late June in 2001 and April in
   2002), which resulted in differences in the physical pack-ice
   characteristics. Chlorophyll a (chl a) content in ice cores differed
   between the study years, with 2002 having 10-fold higher chl a content.
   The difference in ice-core chl a content is best explained by the timing
   of ice formation that leads to less phytoplankton scavenging from the
   water column and a lack of transfer of solar energy into the pack-ice
   ecosystem. Such a tractable atmosphere ocean-ice-biota coupling may help
   in evaluating underlying processes responsible for long-term trends in
   recruitment cycles of upper trophic levels as well as future projections
   on the response of the Antarctic marine ecosystems to variability in
   local climate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {POLAR BIOLOGY},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Baleen whales and Adelie penguins in the near-shore waters around the
   Antarctic Peninsula forage principally on Antarctic krill. Given the
   spatial overlap in the distribution of these krill predators
   (particularly humpback whales) and their dependence on krill, the goals
   of this paper are to determine if the inter-annual community structure
   and relative abundance of baleen whales around Anvers Island is related
   to krill demography and abundance, and if the potential exists for
   inter-specific interactions between Adelie penguins and baleen. We use
   whale sightings and prey data from both net tows and Adelie penguin
   stomach samples to correlate the abundance of humpback whales with krill
   demography and abundance from 1993 to 2001. We find significant
   relationships between whale abundance and the size-frequency
   distribution of krill targeted by Adelie penguins, as well as the
   foraging success of Adelie penguins. These findings suggest both krill
   predators share common prey preferences in the upper portions of the
   water column around Anvers Island. These findings highlight the need for
   better knowledge of baleen whale foraging ecology and inter-specific
   interactions with penguins, as sea ice and krill populations around the
   Antarctic Peninsula are affected by rapid changes in climate.},

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {358},
Pages = {191-202},
Abstract = {In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are the
   dominant prey item for many predators, and a changing climate may affect
   the biomass of krill available to both predators and the krill fishery.
   We projected growth trajectories for individual krill within cohorts and
   estimated how total biomass in an area available to both predators and
   the fishery may vary from year to year simply due to fluctuations in
   temperature. We used an existing temperature-dependent growth model and
   a time series of temperature data (1970 to 2004) for 2 regions in the
   Southern Ocean: (1) around the Antarctic Peninsula, and (2) around the
   island of South Georgia. The growth model predicted increasing
   individual size within a cohort (in terms of length and weight) with
   increasing temperature in the cooler Antarctic Peninsula region and
   decreasing individual size with increasing temperature in the warmer
   South Georgia region. Years with many cohorts of small individuals in
   the population resulted in biomass well below average, whereas years
   with many cohorts of large individuals resulted in biomass well above
   the average, suggesting that temporal changes in Southern Ocean
   temperatures may have profound effects on the total biomass in an area
   that is available to both predators and the fishery. Moreover, the
   effects of a potentially warming Southern Ocean on krill biomass will
   likely be more pronounced in the warmer regions occupied by krill.},

Abstract = {We developed new perspectives to identify important questions and to
   propose approaches for future research on marine food web lipids. They
   were related to (i) structure and function of lipids, (ii) lipid changes
   during critical life phases, (iii) trophic marker lipids, and (iv)
   potential impact of climate change. The first addresses the role of
   lipids in membranes, storage lipids, and buoyancy with the following key
   question: How are the properties of membranes and deposits affected by
   the various types of lipids? The second deals with the importance of
   various types of lipids during reproduction, development, and resting
   phases and addresses the role of the different storage lipids during
   growth and dormancy. The third relates to trophic marker lipids, which
   are an important tool to follow lipid and energy transfer through the
   food web. The central question is how can fatty acids be used to
   identify and quantify food web relationships? With the fourth,
   hypotheses are presented on effects of global warming, which may result
   in the reduction or change in abundance of large, lipid-rich copepods in
   polar oceans, thereby strongly affecting higher trophic levels. The key
   question is how will lipid dynamics respond to changes in ocean climate
   at high latitudes?.},

Abstract = {Antarctic krill are a key species in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, and
   their life cycle appears to be correlated with, and by implication
   dependent upon, seasonal sea ice dynamics. Moving from correlations with
   environmental parameters to an understanding of the mechanisms that lead
   to these correlations may allow predictions of the consequences of
   climate change on the distribution of favourable habitat for Antarctic
   krill. During winter cruises in 2001 and 2002 in the region west of the
   Antarctic Peninsula, one of the most rapidly warming regions on the
   planet, ice camps were established for periods of 3-9 days. Timing of
   sea ice advance, chlorophyll a concentrations in ice cores, and growth
   rates and pigment content of larval krill all differed significantly
   between winters. Growth rates and pigment content of larval krill from
   the same ice floe were correlated, suggesting that growth rates in
   winter are a function of the biomass of the sea ice microbial community.
   A possible mechanism underlying the correlation between recruitment
   success and timing of ice advance is proposed. In conjunction with other
   postulated habitat requirements, this proposed mechanism allows for
   speculation about future changes in the geographic location of
   favourable habitat for Antarctic krill.},

Title = {The potential role of ammonia as a signal molecule for procellarifform
   seabirds},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {315},
Pages = {271-277},
Abstract = {Procellariiform seabirds (petrels, albatrosses and shearwaters) navigate
   vast distances over seemingly featureless ocean habitat by mechanisms
   that are not well understood. These birds have large olfactory bulbs,
   and the use of smell has been implicated in both foraging and homing
   behavior. While many olfactory cues relevant to these behaviors have
   been identified, ammonia is a potentially significant, biogenic, scented
   compound that has not been studied in this context. Ammonium (NH4+)
   constitutes a primary waste product produced by many of the prey species
   on which procellariiforms forage. Nitrogen waste products, including
   volatilized ammonia (NH3) also scent the terrestrial landscape of
   sub-Antarctic islands where newly breeding procellariiform seabirds
   recruit and raise their young. Since an ability to smell ammonia may be
   relevant to both prey detection and locating colonies or islands, we
   used a non-invasive, behavioral assay to examine whether this scented
   compound is detectable by a candidate test species, the blue petrel
   Halobaena caerulea Gmelin. Our results suggest that these birds can
   detect volatilized ammonia within a concentration range that they may
   naturally encounter (10(-11) to 10(-5) M), and point to ammonia as a
   potential signal molecule in the sub-Antarctic.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {84},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1598-1607},

Abstract = {The distribution and abundance of organisms are affected by behaviors,
   such as habitat selection, foraging, and reproduction. These behaviors
   are driven by interactions within and between species, environmental
   conditions, and the biology of the species involved. Although extensive
   theoretical work has explored predator-prey dynamics, these models have
   not considered the impact of behavioral plasticity and life-history
   trade-offs on predicted patterns. We apply a modeling method that allows
   the consideration of a spatial, dynamic ecological game between
   predators and prey using a life-history perspective. As an illustrative
   example, we model the habitat selection of Antarctic krill- and penguins
   during the time when penguins are land-based for reproduction. Although
   environmental conditions and the life-history constraints of each
   species have both direct and indirect effects on both species, the
   penguin's foraging rule (whether food-maximizing or time-minimizing) has
   the greatest effect on the qualitative distribution pattern of both
   species. Size-dependent-diel vertical migration of krill also strongly
   affects penguin foraging patterns. This model generates suggestions for
   future research and qualitative predictions that can be tested in the
   field. The application of this method to a specific problem also
   demonstrates its ability to increase our understanding of important
   ecological interactions in general.},

Abstract = {Long-term changes in the physical environment in the Antarctic Peninsula
   region have significant potential for affecting populations of Antarctic
   krill (Euphausia superba), a keystone food web species. In order to
   investigate this, we analysed data on krill-eating predators at South
   Georgia from 1980 to 2000. Indices of population size and reproductive
   performance showed declines in all species and an increase in the
   frequency of years of low reproductive output. Changes in the population
   structure of krill and its relationship with reproductive performance
   suggested that the biomass of krill within the largest size class was
   sufficient to support predator demand in the 1980s but not in the 1990s.
   We suggest that the effects of underlying changes in the system on the
   krill population structure have been amplified by predator-induced
   mortality, resulting in breeding predators now regularly operating close
   to the limit of krill availability. Understanding how krill demography
   is affected by changes in physical environmental factors and by predator
   consumption and how, in turn, this influences predator performance and
   survival, is one of the keys to predicting future change in Antarctic
   marine ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Every spring for the past two decades, depletion of stratospheric ozone
   has caused increases in ultraviolet B radiation (UVB, 280-320 nm)
   reaching Antarctic terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Research efforts to
   evaluate the impact of this phenomenon have focused on phytoplankton
   under the assumption that ecosystem effects will most likely originate
   through reductions in primary productivity; however, phytoplankton do
   not represent the only significant component in ecosystem response to
   elevated UVB. Antarctic bacterioplankton are adversely affected by UVB
   exposure; and invertebrates and fish, particularly early developmental
   stages that reside in the plankton, are sensitive to UVB. There is
   little Information available on UV responses of larger Antarctic marine
   animals (e.g., birds, seals and whales). Understanding the balance
   between direct biological damage and species-specific potentials for UV
   tolerance (protection and recovery) relative to trophic dynamics and
   biogeochemical cycling is a crucial factor in evaluating the overall
   impact of ozone depletion. After more than a decade of research, much
   Information has been gathered about UV-photobiology in Antarctica;
   however, a definitive quantitative assessment of the effect of ozone
   depletion on the Antarctic ecosystem still eludes us. It is only obvious
   that ozone depletion has not had a catastrophic effect in the Antarctic
   region. The long-term consequences of possible subtle shifts In species
   composition and trophic interactions are still uncertain.},

Abstract = {The changing nature of marine fisheries requires management approaches
   that recognize and include ecosystem and environmental effects.
   Therefore, we review some examples of exploited fishery stocks in which
   environmental control is a major contributor to structuring the
   abundance and distribution of the stock. Four examples, taken from
   studies of northern cod (Gadus morhua), cod and haddock (Melanogrammus
   aeglefinus) larvae, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and
   Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), are given that clearly illustrate
   environmental control on the fishery. From these examples, we argue that
   future management strategies for exploited fisheries must include
   effects of environmental variability. In particular, management
   strategies must be flexible enough to include delayed responses to
   environmental variations that result from the transfer of perturbations
   from larger to smaller scales and vice versa. This capability requires
   an understanding of where linkages between the physical environment and
   the species of interest occur. Development of this knowledge requires
   input from a variety of disciplines, coordinated research programs, and
   considerable cooperation at national and international levels.},

Abstract = {Four species of seals occupy the pack-ice region of the oceans
   surrounding the Antarctic Continent.  These seals include the crabeater
   (Lobodon carcinophagus), Leopard (Hydrurga leptonyx), weddell
   (Leptonychotes weddellii), and ross and are true seals with special
   adaptations for living in the pack-ice region.  Two other seal species,
   the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) and the fur seal
   (Arctocephalus gazella) (the only eared seal of this region) generally
   occur further to the north and use land rather than ice during the
   period of birth of young.  This paper reviews the status of these
   species, and examines the general ecology of the four species that
   inhabit the pack-ice zone.  In general, the four species that occupy the
   pack-ice zone have specialized in habitats and habits so that little
   overlap in diets or habitat use exist among these species.  The
   exception is the interaction between the leopard and the crabeater which
   occupy the same regions and eat krill (Euphausia superba), particularly
   during the winter.  The impact of the potential harvest of krill by man
   on these species is discussed.  Further, the impact that recovery of the
   large baleen whales that feed in this region during the summer is
   discussed with regard to the changes that might occur as competition for
   krill by the large vertebrate species increases.},
